    <h2>
      THE QUEEN&rsquo;S BIRTHDAY DRAWING ROOM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      January. Go back to the 16th, when I went to town, accompanied only by Mr.
      de Luc. I saw my dear father the next morning, who gave me a poem on the
      queen&rsquo;s birthday, to present. It was very pretty; but I felt very
      awkward in offering it to her, as it was from so near a relation, and
      without any particular reason or motive. Mr. Smelt came and stayed with me
      almost all the morning, and soothed and solaced me by his charming
      converse. The rest of the day was devoted to milliners, mantua-makers, and
      such artificers, and you may easily conjecture how great must be my
      fatigue. Nevertheless, when, in the midst of these wasteful toils, the
      Princess Augusta entered my room, and asked me, from the queen, if I
      should wish to see the ball the next day, I preferred running the risk of
      that new fatigue, to declining an honour so offered: especially as the
      Princess Augusta was herself to open the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chance question this night from the queen, whom I now again attended as
      usual, fortunately relieved me from my embarrassment about the poem. She
      inquired of me if my father was still writing? &ldquo;A little,&rdquo; I
      answered, and the next morning, Thursday, the 18th, when the birth-day was
      kept, I found her all sweetness and serenity; mumbled out my own little
      compliment, which she received as graciously as if she had understood and
      heard it; and then,<span class="pagenum">10</span><a name="link10"
      id="link10"></a> when she was dressed, I followed her through the great
      rooms, to get rid of the wardrobe woman, and there taking the poem from my
      pocket, I said &ldquo;I told your majesty that my father had written a
      little!&mdash;and here&mdash;the little is!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it from me with a smile and a curtsey, and I ran off. She never
      has named it since; but she has spoken of my father with much sweetness
      and complacency. The modest dignity of the queen, upon all subjects of
      panegyric, is truly royal and noble.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had now, a second time, the ceremony of being entirely new dressed. I
      then went to St. James&rsquo;s, where the queen gave a very gracious
      approbation of my gewgaws, and called upon the king to bestow the same;
      which his constant goodhumour makes a matter of great ease to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen&rsquo;s dress, being for her own birthday, was extremely simple,
      the style of dress considered. The king was quite superb, and the
      Princesses Augusta and Elizabeth were ornamented with much brilliancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only the princess royal was missed at this exhibition, but also the
      Prince of Wales. He wrote, however, his congratulations to the queen,
      though the coldness then subsisting between him and his majesty occasioned
      his absence from Court. I fear it was severely felt by his royal mother,
      though she appeared composed and content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two princesses spoke very kind words, also, about my frippery on this
      festival; and Princess Augusta laid her positive commands upon me that I
      should change my gown before I went to the lord chamberlain&rsquo;s box,
      where only my head could be seen. The counsel proved as useful as the
      consideration was amiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the queen was attired, the Duchess of Ancaster was admitted to the
      dressing room, where she stayed, in conversation with their majesties and
      the princesses, till it was time to summon the bed-chamber women. During
      this, I had the office of holding the queen&rsquo;s train. I knew, for me,
      it was a great honour, yet it made me feel, once more, so like a mute upon
      the stage, that I could scarce believe myself only performing my own real
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Stainforth and I had some time to stand upon the stairs before the
      opening of the doors. We joined Mrs. Fielding and her daughters, and all
      entered together, but the crowd parted us&mdash;they all ran on, and got
      in as they could, and I <span class="pagenum">11</span><a name="link11"
      id="link11"></a> remained alone by the door. They soon found me out, and
      made signs to me, which I saw not, and then they sent me messages that
      they had kept room for me just by them. I had received orders from the
      queen to go out at the end of the second country dance; I thought,
      therefore, that as I now was seated by the door, I had better be content,
      and stay where I could make my exit in a moment, and without trouble or
      disturbance. A queer-looking old lady sat next me, and I spoke to her now
      and then, by way of seeming to belong to somebody. She did not appear to
      know whether it were advisable for her to answer me or not, seeing me
      alone, and with high head ornaments; but as I had no plan but to save
      appearances to the surrounders, I was perfectly satisfied that my very
      concise propositions should meet with yet more laconic replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we parted, however, finding me quiet and inoffensive, she became
      voluntarily sociable, and I felt so much at home, by being still in a part
      of the palace, that I needed nothing further than just so much notice as
      not to seem an object to be avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight which called me to that spot perfectly answered all my
      expectations: the air, manner, and countenance of the queen, as she goes
      round the circle, are truly graceful and engaging: I thought I could
      understand, by the motion of her lips, and the expression of her face,
      even at the height and distance of the chamberlain&rsquo;s box, the
      gracious and pleasant speeches she made to all whom she approached. With
      my glass, you know, I can see just as other people see with the naked eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princesses looked extremely lovely, and the whole Court was in the
      utmost splendour.

    <h2>
      A SERIOUS DILEMMA.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the appointed moment I slipped through the door, leaving my old lady
      utterly astonished at my sudden departure, and I passed, alone and
      quietly, to Mr. Rhamus&rsquo;s apartment, which was appropriated for the
      company to wait in. Here I desired a servant I met with to call my man: he
      was not to be found. I went down the stairs, and made them call him aloud,
      by my name; all to no purpose. Then the chairmen were called, but called
      also in vain!
    </p>
    <p>
      What to do I knew not; though I was still in a part of the <span
      class="pagenum">12</span><a name="link12" id="link12"></a> palace, it was
      separated by many courts, avenues, passages, and alleys, from the queen&rsquo;s
      or my own apartments&mdash;and though I had so lately passed them, I could
      not remember the way, nor at that late hour could I have walked, dressed
      as I then was, and the ground wet with recent rain, even if I had had a
      servant: I had therefore ordered the chair allotted me for these days; but
      chair and chairmen and footmen were alike out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      My fright lest the queen should wait for me was very serious. I believe
      there are state apartments through which she passes, and therefore I had
      no chance to know when she retired from the ball-room. Yet could I not
      stir, and was forced to return to the room whence I came, in order to wait
      for John, that I might be out of the way of the cold winds which infested
      the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now found a young clergyman, standing by the fire. I suppose my anxiety
      was visible, for he instantly inquired if he could assist me. I declined
      his offer, but walked up and down, making frequent questions about my
      chair and John.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then very civilly said, &ldquo;You seem distressed, ma&rsquo;am; would
      you permit me the honour to see for your chair, or, if it is not come, as
      you seem hurried, would you trust me to see you home?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him, but could not accept his services. He was sorry, he said,
      that I refused him, but could not wonder, as he was a stranger. I made
      some apologising answer, and remained in that unpleasant situation till,
      at length, a hackneychair was procured me. My new acquaintance would take
      no denial to handing me to the chair. When I got in, I told the men to
      carry me to the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are there now!&rdquo; cried they; &ldquo;what part of the
      palace?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was now in a distress the most extraordinary: I really knew not my own
      direction! I had always gone to my apartment in a chair, and had been
      carried by chairmen officially appointed; and, except that it was in St.
      James&rsquo;s palace, I knew nothing of my own situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Near the park,&rdquo; I told them, and saw my new esquire look
      utterly amazed at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;half the palace is in the park.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to direct,&rdquo; cried I, in the greatest
      embarrassment, &ldquo;but it is somewhere between Pall Mall and the park.&rdquo;
      <span class="pagenum">13</span><a name="link13" id="link13"></a> &ldquo;I
      know where the lady lives well enough,&rdquo; cried one of the chairmen,
      &ldquo;&rsquo;tis in St. James&rsquo;s street.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis in St. James&rsquo;s
      palace.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up with the chair!&rdquo; cried the other man, &ldquo;I know best&mdash;&rsquo;tis
      in South Audley-street; I know the lady well enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Think what a situation at the moment! I found they had both been drinking
      the queen&rsquo;s health till they knew not what they said and could with
      difficulty stand. Yet they lifted me up, and though I called in the most
      terrible fright to be let out, they carried me down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now actually screamed for help, believing they would carry me off to
      South Audley Street; and now my good genius, who had waited patiently in
      the crowd, forcibly stopped the chairmen, who abused him violently, and
      opened the door himself, and I ran back to the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may imagine how earnestly I returned my thanks for this most
      seasonable assistance, without which I should almost have died with
      terror, for where they might have taken or dropped me, or how or where
      left me, who could say?
    </p>
    <p>
      He begged me to go again upstairs, but my apprehension about the queen
      prevented me. I knew she was to have nobody but me, and that her jewels,
      though few, were to be intrusted back to the queen&rsquo;s house to no
      other hands. I must, I said, go, be it in what manner it might. All I
      could devise was to summon Mr. Rhamus, the page. I had never seen him, but
      my attendance upon the queen would be an apology for the application, and
      I determined to put myself under his immediate protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rhamus was nowhere to be found; he was already supposed to be gone to
      the queen&rsquo;s house, to wait the arrival of his majesty. This news
      redoubled my fear; and now my new acquaintance desired me to employ him in
      making inquiries for me as to the direction I wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost ridiculous, in the midst of my distress, to be thus at a
      loss for an address to myself! I felt averse to speaking my name amongst
      so many listeners, and only told him he would much oblige me by finding
      out a direction to Mrs. Haggerdorn&rsquo;s rooms. He went upstairs; and
      returning, said he could now direct the chairmen, if I did not fear
      trusting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did fear&mdash;I even shook with fear; yet my horror of disappointing
      the queen upon such a night prevailed over all my reluctance, and I
      ventured once more into the chair, thanking this excellent Samaritan, and
      begging him to give the direction very particularly.<span class="pagenum">14</span><a
      name="link14" id="link14"></a> Imagine, however, my gratitude and my
      relief, when, instead of hearing the direction, I heard only these words,
      &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo; And then did this truly benevolent young man
      himself play the footman, in walking by the side of the chair till we came
      to an alley, when he bid them turn; but they answered him with an oath,
      and ran on with me, till the poles ran against a wall, for they had
      entered a passage in which there was no outlet! I would fain have got out,
      but they would not hear me; they would only pull the chair back, and go on
      another way. But my guardian angel told them to follow him, or not, at
      their peril; and then walked before the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      We next came to a court where we were stopped by the sentinels. They said
      they had orders not to admit any hackney chairs. The chairmen vowed they
      would make way; I called out aloud to be set down; the sentinels said they
      would run their bayonets through the first man that attempted to dispute
      their orders. I then screamed out again to be set down, and my new and
      good friend peremptorily forced them to stop, and opening the door with
      violence, offered me his arm, saying, &ldquo;You had better trust yourself
      with me, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Most thankfully I now accepted what so fruitlessly I had declined, and I
      held by his arm, and we walked on together, but neither of us knew
      whither, nor the right way from the wrong. It was really a terrible
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chairmen followed us, clamorous for money, and full of abuse. They
      demanded half a crown&mdash;my companion refused to listen to such an
      imposition: my shaking hand could find no purse, and I begged him to pay
      them what they asked, that they might leave us. He did; and when they were
      gone, I shook less, and was able to pay that one part of the debt I was
      now contracting.
    </p>
    <p>
      We wandered about, heaven knows where, in a way the most alarming and
      horrible to myself imaginable: for I never knew where I was.&mdash;It was
      midnight. I concluded the queen waiting for me.&mdash;It was wet. My head
      was full dressed. I was under the care of a total stranger; and I knew not
      which side to take, wherever we came. Inquiries were vain. The sentinels
      alone were in sight, and they are so continually changed that they knew no
      more of Mrs. Haggerdorn than if she had never resided here.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length I spied a door open, and I begged to enter it at a venture, for
      information. Fortunately a person stood in the passage who instantly spoke
      to me by my name; I never<span class="pagenum">15</span><a name="link15"
      id="link15"></a> heard that sound with more glee: to me he was a stranger,
      but I suppose he had seen me in some of the apartments. I begged him to
      direct me straight to the queen&rsquo;s rooms: he did; and I then took
      leave of my most humane new friend, with a thousand acknowledgments for
      his benevolence and services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it not a strange business? I can never say what an agony Of fright it
      cost me at the time, nor ever be sufficiently grateful for the kind
      assistance, so providentially afforded me.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      COUNSELS OF A COURT OFFICIAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The general directions and counsel of Mr. Smelt, which I have scrupulously
      observed ever since, were, in abridgment, these:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      That I should see nobody at all but by appointment. This, as he well said,
      would obviate, not only numerous personal inconveniences to myself, but
      prevent alike surprises from those I had no leave to admit, and
      repetitions of visits from others who might inadvertently come too often.
      He advised me to tell this to my father, and beg it might be spread, as a
      settled part of my situation, among all who inquired for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      That I should see no fresh person whatsoever without an immediate
      permission from the queen, nor any party, even amongst those already
      authorised, without apprising her of such a plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      That I should never go out without an immediate application to her, so
      that no possible inquiry for me might occasion surprise or disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      These, and other similar ties, perhaps, had my spirits been better, I
      might less readily have acceded to: as it was, I would have bound myself
      to as many more.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, however, even then, I was startled when Mr. Smelt, with some
      earnestness, said, &ldquo;And, with respect to your parties, such as you
      may occasionally have here, you have but one rule for keeping all things
      smooth, and all partisans unoffended, at a distance&mdash;which is, to
      have no men&mdash;none!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I stared a little, and made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;Mr. Locke may be admitted; but him
      only. Your father, you know, is of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still I was silent: after a pause of some length, he plumply Yet with an
      evidently affected unmeaningness, said, &ldquo;Mr. Cambridge&mdash;as to
      Mr. Cambridge&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped him short at once; I dared not trust to what<span class="pagenum">16</span><a
      name="link16" id="link16"></a> might follow, and eagerly called Out,
      &ldquo;Mr. Cambridge, Sir, I cannot exclude! So much friendship and
      kindness I owe, and have long owed him, that he would go about howling at
      my ingratitude, could I seem so suddenly to forget it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      My impetuosity in uttering this surprised, but silenced him; he said not a
      word more, nor did I.

    <h2>
      MR. TURBULENT&rsquo;s ANXIETY TO INTRODUCE MR. WELLBRED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Windsor, Sunday, Jan. 28.&mdash;-I was too ill to go to church. I was now,
      indeed, rarely well enough for anything but absolute and unavoidable
      duties; and those were still painfully and forcibly performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had only Miss Planta for my guest, and when she went to the princesses I
      retired for a quiet and solitary evening to my own room. But here, while
      reading, I was interrupted by a tat-tat at my door. I opened it and saw
      Mr. Turbulent.... He came forward, and began a gay and animated
      conversation, with a flow of spirits and good humour which I had never
      observed in him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      His darling colonel<a href="#linknote-230" name="linknoteref-230"
      id="linknoteref-230"><small>230</small></a> was the subject that he still
      harped upon; but it was only with a civil and amusing raillery, not, as
      before, with an overpowering vehemence to conquer. Probably, however, the
      change in myself might be as observable as in him,&mdash;since I now
      ceased to look upon him with that distance and coldness which hitherto he
      had uniformly found in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must give you a little specimen of him in this new dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some general talk,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;am I to have the honour
      of introducing Colonel Wellbred to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I have not settled that entirely!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reflect a little, then, ma&rsquo;am, and tell me. I only wish to
      know when.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed to tell you that is somewhat more than I am able to do; I
      must find it out myself, first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, make the inquiry as speedily as possible, I beg.
      What say you to now? shall I call him up?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&mdash;pray let him alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will you not, at least, tell me your reasons for this conduct?"<span
      class="pagenum">17</span><a name="link17" id="link17"></a> &ldquo;Why,
      frankly, then, if you will hear them and be quiet, I will confess them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I then told him, that I had so little time to myself, that to gain even a
      single evening was to gain a treasure; and that I had no chance but this.
      &ldquo;Not,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that I wish to avoid him, but to break
      the custom of constantly meeting with the equerries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is impossible to break the custom, ma&rsquo;am; it has been
      so always: the tea-table has been the time of uniting the company, ever
      since the king came to Windsor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but everything now is upon a new construction. I am not
      positively bound to do everything Mrs. Haggerdorn did, and his having
      drank tea with her will not make him conclude he must also drink tea with
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, that is true, I allow. Nothing that belonged to her can
      bring conclusions round to you. But still, why begin with Colonel
      Wellbred? You did not treat Colonel Goldsworthy so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not the power of beginning with him. I did what I could, I
      assure you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Price, ma&rsquo;am?&mdash;I never heard you avoided him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I knew him before I came, and he knew much of my family,
      and indeed I am truly sorry that I shall now see no more of him. But
      Colonel Wellbred and I are mutually strangers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All people are so at first, every acquaintance must have a
      beginning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this, if you are quiet, we are most willing should have none.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;he is not so willing; he wishes to come.
      He asked me, to-day, if I had spoke about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I disclaimed believing this; but he persisted in asserting it, adding
      &ldquo;For he said if I had spoke he would come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very condescending,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;but I am satisfied
      he would not think of it at all, if you did not put it in his head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honour, You are mistaken; we talk just as much of it down
      there as up here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would much oblige me if you would not talk of it,&mdash;neither
      there nor here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me end it, then, by bringing him at once!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, leave us both alone: he has his resources and his
      engagements as much as I have; we both are best as we now are."<span
      class="pagenum">18</span><a name="link18" id="link18"></a> &ldquo;But what
      can he say, ma&rsquo;am? Consider his confusion and disgrace! It is well
      known, in the world, the private life that the royal family live at
      Windsor, and who are the attendants that belong to them; and when Colonel
      Wellbred quits his waiting&mdash;three months&rsquo; waiting and is asked
      how he likes Miss Burney, he must answer he has never seen her! And what,
      ma&rsquo;am, has Colonel Wellbred done to merit such a mortification?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible not to laugh at such a statement of the case; and again
      he requested to bring him directly. &ldquo;One quarter of an hour will
      content me; I only wish to introduce him&mdash;for the sake of his credit
      in the world; and when once you have met, you need meet no more; no
      consequences whatever need be drawn to the detriment of your solitude.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged him to desist, and let us both rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But have you, yourself, ma&rsquo;am, no curiosity&mdash;no desire
      to see Colonel Wellbred?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, then, hereafter you admit any other equerry&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I intend to carry the new construction throughout.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or if you suffer anyone else to bring you Colonel Wellbred.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend upon it I have no such intention.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if any other more eloquent man prevails&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be assured there is no danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you, at least, promise I shall be present at the meet&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no meeting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are certainly, then, afraid of him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I denied this, and, hearing the king&rsquo;s supper called, he took his
      leave; though not before I very seriously told him that, however amusing
      all this might be as pure badinage, I Should be very earnestly vexed if he
      took any steps in the matter without my consent.

    <h2>
      COLONEL WELLBRED IS RECEIVED AT TEA.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Feb. 2.&mdash;-MISS Planta came to tea, and we went together to the
      eating-parlour, which we found quite empty. Mr. Turbulent&rsquo;s studious
      table was all deserted, and his books laid waste; but in a very few
      minutes he entered again, with his arms spread wide, his face all glee,
      and his voice all triumph, calling out,<span class="pagenum">19</span><a
      name="link19" id="link19"></a> &ldquo;Mr. Smelt and Colonel Wellbred
      desire leave to wait upon miss Burney to tea!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A little provoked at this determined victory over my will and my wish, I
      remained silent,&mdash;but Miss Planta broke forth into open upbraidings:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Mr. Turbulent, this is really abominable it is all
      your own doing&mdash;and if I was Miss Burney I would not bear it!&rdquo;
      and much more, till he fairly gave her to understand she had nothing to do
      with the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning to me, &ldquo;What am I to say, ma&rsquo;am? am I to tell
      Colonel Wellbred you hesitate?&rdquo; He protested he came upon the
      embassy fairly employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not fairly, I am sure, Mr. Turbulent The whole is a device and
      contrivance of your own! Colonel Wellbred would have been as quiet as
      myself, had you left him alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t throw it all upon me, ma&rsquo;am; &rsquo;tis Mr.
      Smelt. But what are they to think of this delay? are they to suppose it
      requires deliberation whether or not you can admit a gentleman to your
      tea-table?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged him to tell me, at least, how it had passed, and in what manner
      he had brought his scheme about. But he would give me no satisfaction; he
      only said &ldquo;You refuse to receive him, ma&rsquo;am?&mdash;shall I go
      and tell him you refuse to receive him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O No!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was enough&mdash;he waited no fuller consent, but ran off. Miss
      Planta began a good-natured repining for me. I determined to fetch some
      work before they arrived; and in coming for it to my own room, I saw Mr.
      Turbulent, not yet gone downstairs. I really believe, by the strong marks
      of laughter on his countenance, that he had stopped to compose himself
      before he could venture to appear in the equerryroom!
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him reproachfully, and passed on; he shook his head at me in
      return, and hied downstairs. I had but just time to rejoin Miss Planta
      when he led the way to the two Other gentlemen: entering first, with the
      most earnest curiosity, to watch the scene. Mr. Smelt followed,
      introducing the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could almost have laughed, so ridiculous had the behaviour of Mr.
      Turbulent, joined to his presence and watchfulness, rendered this meeting;
      and I saw in Colonel Wellbred the most evident marks of similar
      sensations: for he coloured<span class="pagenum">20</span><a name="link20"
      id="link20"></a> violently on his entrance, and seemed in an embarrassment
      that, to any one who knew not the previous tricks of Mr. Turbulent, must
      have appeared really distressing. And, in truth, Mr. Smelt himself, little
      imagining what had preceded the interview, was so much struck with his
      manner and looks, that he conceived him to be afraid of poor little me,
      and observed, afterwards, with what &ldquo;blushing diffidence&rdquo; he
      had begun the acquaintance!
    </p>
    <p>
      I, who saw the true cause through the effect, felt more provoked than ever
      with Mr. Turbulent, since I was now quite satisfied he had been as busy
      with the colonel about me, as with me about the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is tall, his figure is very elegant, and his face very handsome: he is
      sensible, well-bred, modest, and intelligent. I had always been told he
      was very amiable and accomplished, and the whole of his appearance
      confirmed the report.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discourse was almost all Mr. Smelt&rsquo;s, the colonel was silent and
      reserved, and Mr. Turbulent had resolved to be a mere watchman. The king
      entered early and stayed late, and took away with him, on retiring, all
      the gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feb. 3.&mdash;-As the tea hour approached, to-day, Mr. Turbulent grew very
      restless. I saw what was passing in his mind, and therefore forbore
      ordering tea; but presently, and suddenly, as if from some instant
      impulse, he gravely came up to me, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go and call the colonel, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; was my Johnsonian reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, ma&rsquo;am!&mdash;won&rsquo;t you give him a little tea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no!&mdash;I beg you will be at rest!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders, and walked away; and Mr. Smelt, smiling, said,
      &ldquo;Will you give us any?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes, surely,&rdquo; cried I, and was going away to ring for the
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe I have already mentioned that I had no bell at all, except in my
      bedroom, and that only for my maid, whom I was obliged to summon first,
      like Smart&rsquo;s monkey&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Betty!&mdash;Nan!&mdash;Go, call the maid, to call the man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For Mrs. Haggerdorn had done without, twenty-six years, by always keeping
      her servant in waiting at the door. I could never endure inflicting such a
      hardship, and therefore had always to run to my bedroom, and wait the
      progress of the maid&rsquo;s arrival, and then of her search of the man,
      ere ever<span class="pagenum">21</span><a name="link21" id="link21"></a> I
      could give him an order. A mighty tiresome and inconvenient ceremony. Mr
      Turbulent insisted upon saving me this trouble, and went &lsquo;out
      himself to speak to John. But you will believe me a little amazed, when,
      in a very few minutes, he returned again, accompanied by his colonel! My
      surprise brought the colour both into my own cheeks and those of my
      guests. Mr. Smelt looked pleased; and Mr. Turbulent, though I saw he was
      half afraid of what he was doing, could by no means restrain a most
      exulting smile, which was constantly in play during the whole evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smelt instantly opened a conversation, with an ease and good breeding
      which drew every one into sharing it. The colonel was far less reserved
      and silent, and I found him very pleasing, very unassuming, extremely
      attentive, and sensible and obliging. The moment, however, that we
      mutually joined in the discourse, Mr. Turbulent came to my side, and
      seating himself there, whispered that he begged my pardon for the step he
      had taken. I made him no answer, but talked on with the colonel and Mr.
      Smelt. He then whispered me again, &ldquo;I am now certain of your
      forgiveness, since I see your approbation!&rdquo; And when still I said
      nothing, he interrupted every speech to the colonel with another little
      whisper, saying that his end was obtained, and he was now quite happy,
      since he saw he had obliged me!
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he proceeded so far, with so positive a determination to be
      answered, that he absolutely compelled me to say I forgave him, lest he
      should go on till the colonel heard him.

    <h2>
      ECCENTRIC MR. BRYANT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Feb. 9-This morning, soon after my breakfast, the princess royal came to
      fetch me to the queen. She talked of Mrs. Delany all the way, and in terms
      of affection that can never fail to raise her in the minds of all who hear
      her. The queen was alone; and told me she had been so much struck with the
      Duke of Suffolk&rsquo;s letter to his son, in the Paston collection,<a
      href="#linknote-231" name="linknoteref-231" id="linknoteref-231"><small>231</small></a>
      <span class="pagenum">22</span><a name="link22" id="link22"></a> that she
      wished to hear my opinion of it. She then condescended to read it to me.
      It is indeed both instructive and interesting. She was so gracious, when
      she dismissed me, as to lend me the book, desiring me to have it sent back
      to her apartment when I went to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had invited Mr. Bryant to dinner. He came an hour before, and I could
      not read &ldquo;Paston,&rdquo; but rejoiced the more in his living
      intelligence. We talked upon the &ldquo;Jew&rsquo;s Letters,&rdquo; which
      he had lent me. Have I mentioned them? They are a mighty well written
      defence of the Mosaic law and mission, and as orthodox for Christians as
      for Jews, with regard to their main tenor, which is to refute the infidel
      doctrine of Voltaire up to the time of our Saviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before our dinner we were joined by &lsquo;Mr. Smelt; and the conversation
      was then very good. The same subject was continued, except where it was
      interrupted by Mr. Bryant&rsquo;s speaking of his own works, which was
      very frequently, and with a droll sort of simplicity that had a mixture of
      nature and of humour extremely amusing. He told us, very frankly his
      manner of writing; he confessed that what he first committed to paper
      seldom could be printed without variation or correction, even to a single
      line: he copied everything over, he said, himself, and three transcribings
      were the fewest he could ever make do; but, generally, nothing went from
      him to the press under seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Turbulent and Miss Planta came to dinner, and it was very cheerful.
      Ere it was over John told me somebody wanted me. I desired they might be
      shewn to my room till the things were removed; but, as these were some
      time taking away, I called John to let me know who it was. &ldquo;The
      princess royal, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; was his answer, with perfect ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up I started, ashamed and eager, and flew to her royal highness instantly:
      and I found her calmly and quietly waiting, shut up in my room, without
      any candles, and almost wholly in the dark, except from the light of the
      fire! I made all possible apologies, and doubled and trebled them upon her
      Smilingly saying &ldquo;I would not let them tell you who it was, nor
      hurry you, for I know &rsquo;tis so disagreeable to be called <span
      class="pagenum">23</span><a name="link23" id="link23"></a> away in the
      middle of dinner.&rdquo; And then, to reconcile me to the little accident,
      she took hold of both my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to me from the queen, about the &ldquo;Paston Letters,&rdquo;
      which John had not carried to the right page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon after came the king, who entered into a gay disquisition with
      Mr. Bryant upon his school achievements to which he answered with a
      readiness and simplicity highly entertaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an Etonian, Mr. Bryant,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;but
      pray, for what were you most famous at school?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We all expected, from the celebrity of his scholarship, to hear him answer
      his Latin Exercises but no such thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cudgelling, Sir. I was most famous for that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While a general laugh followed this speech, he very gravely proceeded to
      particularize his feats though unless you could see the diminutive figure,
      the weak, thin, feeble, little frame, whence issued the proclamation of
      his prowess, you can but very Inadequately judge the comic effect of his
      big talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, sir, knows General Conway? I broke his head for him,
      sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The shout which ensued did not at all interfere with the steadiness of his
      further detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another man, Sir, a great stout fellow, Sir, as
      ever you saw&mdash;Dr. Gibbon, of the Temple: I broke his head too, sir.&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know if he remembers it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, afterwards, inquired after his present family, meaning his dogs,
      which he is famed for breeding and preserving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I have now only twelve. Once,
      I recollect, when your majesty was so gracious as to ask me about them, I
      happened to have twenty-two; and so I told you, sir. Upon my word, Sir, it
      made me very uneasy afterwards when I came to reflect upon it: I was
      afraid your majesty might think I presumed to joke!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The king then asked him for some account of the Marlborough family, with
      which he is very particularly connected and desired to know which among
      the young Lady Spencers was his favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, sir, I like them all! Lady Elizabeth is a charming
      young lady&mdash;I believe, Sir, I am most in her favour; I don&rsquo;t
      know why, Sir. But I happened to write a letter to the duke, sir, that she
      took a fancy to; I don&rsquo;t know the reason, sir, but she begged it. I
      don&rsquo;t know what was in the letter,<span class="pagenum">24</span><a
      name="link24" id="link24"></a> sir-I could never find out; but she took a
      prodigious fancy to it, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The king laughed heartily, and supposed there might be some compliments to
      herself in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word&rsquo; sir,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I am afraid your
      majesty will think I was in love with her! but indeed, sir, I don&rsquo;t
      know what was in the letter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The converse went on in the same style, and the king was so much
      entertained by Mr. Bryant, that he stayed almost the whole evening.

    <h2>
      MR TURBULENT IN A NEW CHARACTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Friday, Feb. 16.&mdash;The instant I was left alone with Mr. Turbulent he
      demanded to know my &ldquo;project for his happiness;&rdquo; and he made
      his claim in a tone so determined, that I saw it would be fruitless to
      attempt evasion or delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your captivity, then, sir,&rdquo; cried I-&ldquo;for such I must
      call your regarding your attendance to be indispensable is at an end: the
      equerry-coach is now wholly in your power. I have spoken myself upon the
      subject to the queen, as you bid&mdash;at least, braved me to do; and I
      have now her consent to discharging you from all necessity of travelling
      in our coach."<a href="#linknote-232" name="linknoteref-232"
      id="linknoteref-232"><small>232</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked extremely provoked, and asked if I really meant to inform him I
      did not choose his company? I laughed the question off, and used a world
      of civil argument to persuade him I had only done him a good office: but I
      was fain to make the whole debate as sportive as possible, as I saw him
      disposed to be seriously affronted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long debate ensued. I had been, he protested, excessively ill-natured to
      him. &ldquo;What an impression,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;must this make
      upon the queen! After travelling, with apparent content, six years With
      that oyster Mrs. Haggerdorn&mdash;now&mdash;now that travelling is become
      really agreeable&mdash;in that coach&mdash;I am to be turned out of it!
      How must it disgrace me in her opinion!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was too partial, I said, to &ldquo;that oyster,&rdquo; to look upon
      the matter in such a degrading light nor would she think of it<span
      class="pagenum">25</span><a name="link25" id="link25"></a> at all, but as
      an accidental matter. I then added, that the reason that he had hitherto
      been destined to the female coach was, that Mrs. Schwellenberg and Mrs.
      Haggerdorn were always afraid of travelling by themselves; but that as I
      had more courage, there was no need of such slavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slavery!&rdquo;&mdash;repeated he, with an emphasis that almost
      startled me,&mdash;&ldquo;Slavery is pleasure&mdash;is happiness&mdash;when
      directed by our wishes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, with a sudden motion that made me quite jump, he cast himself at
      my feet, on both his knees&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your slave,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I am content to be! your slave
      I am ready to live and die!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged him to rise, and be a little less rhapsodic. &ldquo;I have
      emancipated you,&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;do not, therefore, throw away the
      freedom you have been six years sighing to obtain. You are now your own
      agent&mdash;a volunteer&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am,&rdquo; cried he, impetuously, &ldquo;I dedicate myself to
      you!&mdash;A volunteer, ma&rsquo;am, remember that! I dedicate myself to
      you, therefore, of my own accord, for every journey! You shall not get rid
      of me these twenty years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to get myself away-but he would not let me move and he began, with
      still increasing violence of manner, a most fervent protestation that he
      would not be set aside, and that he devoted himself to me entirely. And,
      to say the simple truth, ridiculous as all this was, I really began to
      grow a little frightened by his vehemence and his posture&mdash;till, at
      last, in the midst of an almost furious vow, in which he dedicated himself
      to me for ever, he relieved me, by suddenly calling upon Jupiter, Juno,
      Mars, and Hercules, and every god, and every goddess, to witness his oath.
      And then, content with his sublimity, he arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it not a curious scene? and have I not a curious fellow traveller for
      my little journeys? Monday, Feb. 19.&mdash;This morning I Proposed to my
      fellow travellers that we should begin our journey on foot. The wonderment
      with which they heard a proposal so new was diverting: but they all agreed
      to it; and though they declared that my predecessor, Mrs. Haggerdorn,
      would have thought the person fit for Bedlam who should have suggested
      such plan, no one could find any real objection, and off we set, ordering
      the coach to proceed slowly after us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was delightful, and the enterprise served to shorten and
      enliven the expedition, and pleased them all, <span class="pagenum">26</span><a
      name="link26" id="link26"></a> Mr. Turbulent began, almost immediately, an
      attack about his colonel: upon quite a new ground, yet as restless and
      earnest as upon the old one. He now reproached my attention to him,
      protesting I talked to him continually, and spun out into an hour&rsquo;s
      discourse what might have been said in three minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was it my spinning?&rdquo; I could not forbear saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am: for you might have dropped it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&mdash;by not answering when spoken to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By not talking to him, ma&rsquo;am, more than to any one else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, Mr. Turbulent, solve me, then, this difficulty; what
      choice has a poor female with whom she may converse? Must she not, in
      company as in dancing, take up with those who choose to take up with her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was staggered by this question, and while he wavered how to answer it,
      I pursued my little advantage&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No man, Mr. Turbulent, has any cause to be flattered that a woman
      talks with him, while it is only in reply; for though he may come, go,
      address or neglect, and do as he will,&mdash;she, let her think and wish
      what she may, must only follow as he leads.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He protested, with great warmth, he never heard any thing so proudly said
      in Ins life. But I would not retract.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;how wondrous
      intimate you are grown! After such averseness to a meeting&mdash;such
      struggles to avoid him; what am I to think of the sincerity of that
      pretended reluctance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must think the truth,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that it was not the
      colonel, but the equerry, I wished to avoid; that it was not the
      individual, but the official necessity of receiving company, that I wished
      to escape.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      BANTERING A PRINCESS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      March 1.&mdash;-With all the various humours in which I had already seen
      Mr. Turbulent, he gave me this evening a surprise, by his behaviour to one
      of the princesses, nearly the same that I had experienced from him myself.
      The Princess Augusta came, during coffee, for a knotting shuttle of the
      queen&rsquo;s. While she was speaking to me, he stood behind and
      exclaimed, a demi voix, as if to himself, &ldquo;Comme elle est jolie ce
      soir, son Altesse Royale!&rdquo; And then, seeing her blush extremely, he
      clasped his hands, in high pretended confusion, <span class="pagenum">27</span><a
      name="link27" id="link27"></a> and hiding his head, called Out, &ldquo;Que
      ferai-je? The princess has heard me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, Mr. Turbulent,&rdquo; cried she, hastily, &ldquo;what play
      are you to read to-night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall choose, ma&rsquo;am; either &lsquo;La Coquette corrigée,&rsquo;
      or&mdash;&rdquo; [he named another I have forgotten.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;that last is shocking! don&rsquo;t
      let me hear that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you, ma&rsquo;am. You fix, then, upon &lsquo;La
      Coquette?&rsquo; &lsquo;La Coquette&rsquo; is your royal highness&rsquo;s
      taste?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, I am sure I did not say that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, by implication. And certainly, therefore, I will
      read it, to please your royal highness!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, pray don&rsquo;t; for I like none of them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of them, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, none;&mdash;no French plays at all!&rdquo; And away she was
      running, with a droll air, that acknowledged she had said something to
      provoke him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a declaration, ma&rsquo;am, I must beg you to explain!&rdquo;
      cried he, gliding adroitly between the princess and the door, and shutting
      it With his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I can&rsquo;t explain it;&mdash;so pray, Mr. Turbulent, do
      open the door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for the world, ma&rsquo;am, with such a stain uncleared upon
      your royal highness&rsquo;s taste and feeling!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She told him she positively could not stay, and begged him to let her pass
      instantly. But he would hear her no more than he has heard me, protesting
      he was too much shocked for her, to suffer her to depart without clearing
      her own credit!
    </p>
    <p>
      He conquered at last, and thus forced to speak, she turned round to us and
      said, &ldquo;Well&mdash;if I must, then&mdash;I will appeal to these
      ladies, who understand such things far better than I do, and ask them if
      it is not true about these French plays, that they are all so like to one
      another, that to hear them in this manner every night is enough to tire
      one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, then, madam,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;if French plays have the
      misfortune to displease you, what national plays have the honour Of your
      preference?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw he meant something that she understood better than me, for she
      blushed again, and called out &ldquo;Pray open the door at once! I can
      stay no longer; do let me go, Mr. Turbulent!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">28</span><a
      name="link28" id="link28"></a> &ldquo;Not till you have answered that
      question, ma&rsquo;am&rsquo; what country has plays to your royal highness&rsquo;s
      taste?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney,&rdquo; cried she impatiently, yet laughing, &ldquo;pray
      do you take him away!&mdash;Pull him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed to me very invitingly for the office but I frankly answered her,
      &ldquo;Indeed, ma&rsquo;am, I dare not undertake him! I cannot manage him
      at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country! the country! Princess Augusta! name the happy country!&rdquo;
      was all she could gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order him away, Miss Burney,&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;It is your
      room: order him away from the door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it, ma&rsquo;am, name it!&rdquo; exclaimed he; &ldquo;name but
      the chosen nation!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, fixing her with the most provoking eyes, &ldquo;Est-ce la
      Danemarc?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She coloured violently, and quite angry with him, called out, &ldquo;Mr.
      Turbulent, how can you be such a fool!&rdquo; And now I found.. . the
      prince royal of Denmark was in his meaning, and in her understanding!
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed to the ground, in gratitude for the term &ldquo;fool,&rdquo; but
      added with pretended Submission to her will, &ldquo;Very well, ma&rsquo;am,
      s&rsquo;il ne faut lire que les comédies Danoises.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do let me go!&rdquo; cried she, seriously; and then he made way,
      with a profound bow as she passed, saying, &ldquo;Very well, ma&rsquo;am,
      &lsquo;La Coquette,&rsquo; then? your royal highness chooses &lsquo;La
      Coquette corrigée?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corrigée? That never was done!&rdquo; cried she, with all her sweet
      good-humour, the moment she got out&mdash;and off she ran, like lightning,
      to the queen&rsquo;s apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      What say you to Mr. Turbulent now?
    </p>
    <p>
      For my part, I was greatly surprised. I had not imagined any man, but the
      king or Prince of Wales, had ever ventured at a badinage of this sort with
      any of the princesses; nor do I suppose any other man ever did. Mr.
      Turbulent is so great a favourite with all the royal family that he safely
      ventures upon whatever he pleases, and doubtless they find, in his courage
      and his rhodomontading, a novelty extremely amusing to them.

    <h2>
      MR. TURBULENT MEETS WITH A REBUFF.
    </h2>
    <p>
      March&mdash;I must now, rather reluctantly I own, come to recite a
      quarrel, a very serious quarrel, in which I have been involved with my
      most extraordinary fellow-traveller. One evening at Windsor Miss Planta
      left the room, while I was<span class="pagenum">29</span><a name="link29"
      id="link29"></a> winding some silk. I was content to stay and finish the
      skein, though my remaining companion was in a humour too flighty to induce
      me to continue with him a moment longer. Indeed I had avoided pretty
      successfully all tête-à-têetes with him since the time when his eccentric
      genius led to such eccentric conduct in our long conference in the last
      month.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, however, when I had done my work, he protested I should stay
      and chat with him. I pleaded business&mdash;letters&mdash;hurry&mdash;all
      in vain: he would listen to nothing, and when I tried to move was so
      tumultuous in his opposition, that I was obliged to re-seat myself to
      appease him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flow of compliments followed, every one of which I liked less and less;
      but his spirits seemed uncontrollable, and, I suppose, ran away with all
      that ought to check them. I laughed and rallied as long as I possibly
      could, and tried to keep him in order, by not seeming to suppose he wanted
      aid for that purpose: yet still, every time I tried to rise, he stopped
      me, and uttered at last Such expressions of homage&mdash;so like what
      Shakspeare says of the school-boy, who makes &ldquo;a sonnet on his
      mistress&rsquo; eyebrow,&rdquo; which is always his favourite theme&mdash;that
      I told him his real compliment was all to my temper, in imagining it could
      brook such mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought him once more on his knees, with such a volley of
      asseverations of his sincerity, uttered with such fervour and eloquence,
      that I really felt uneasy, and used every possible means to get away from
      him, rallying him however all the time, and disguising the consciousness I
      felt of my inability to quit him. More and more vehement, however, he
      grew, till I could be no longer passive, but forcibly rising, protested I
      would not stay another minute. But you may easily imagine my astonishment
      and provocation, when, hastily rising himself, he violently seized hold of
      me, and compelled me to return to my chair, with a force and a freedom
      that gave me as much surprise as offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      All now became serious. Raillery, good-humour, and even pretended ease and
      unconcern, were at an end. The positive displeasure I felt I made
      positively known; and the voice manner, and looks with which I insisted
      upon an immediate&rsquo; release were so changed from what he had ever
      heard or observed in me before, that I saw him quite thunderstruck with
      the alteration; and all his own violence subsiding, he begged my pardon
      with the mildest humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had made me too angry to grant it, and I only desired<span
      class="pagenum">30</span><a name="link30" id="link30"></a> him to let me
      instantly go to my room. He ceased all personal opposition, but going to
      the door, planted himself before it, and said, &ldquo;Not in wrath! I
      cannot let you go away in wrath!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must, sir,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;for I am in wrath!&rdquo; He
      began a thousand apologies, and as many promises of the most submissive
      behaviour in future; but I stopped them all, with a peremptory declaration
      that every minute he detained me made me but the more seriously angry. His
      vehemence now was all changed into strong alarm, and he opened the door,
      profoundly bowing, but not speaking, as I passed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sure I need not dwell upon the uncomfortable sensations I felt, in a
      check so rude and violent to the gaiety and entertainment of an
      acquaintance which had promised me my best amusement during our winter
      campaigns. I was now to begin upon quite a new system, and instead of
      encouraging, as hitherto I had done, everything that could lead to
      vivacity and spirit, I was fain to determine upon the most distant and
      even forbidding demeanour with the only life of our parties, that he might
      not again forget himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This disagreeable conduct I put into immediate practice. I stayed in my
      own room till I heard every one assembled in the next: I was then obliged
      to prepare for joining them, but before I opened the door a gentle rap at
      it made me call out &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; and Mr. Turbulent
      looked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hastily said I was coming instantly, but he advanced softly into the
      room, entreating forgiveness at every step. I made no other answer than
      desiring he would go, and saying I should follow. He went back to the
      door, and, dropping on one knee, said, &ldquo;Miss Burney! surely you
      cannot be seriously angry?-&rsquo;tis so impossible you should think I
      meant to offend you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I said nothing, and did not look near him, but opened the door, from which
      he retreated to make way for me, rising a little mortified, and
      exclaiming, &ldquo;Can you then have such real ill-nature? How little I
      suspected it in you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis you,&rdquo; cried I, as I passed on, &ldquo;that are
      ill-natured!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I meant for forcing me into anger; but I left him to make the meaning out,
      and walked into the next room. He did not immediately follow, and he then
      appeared so much disconcerted that I saw Miss Planta incessantly eyeing
      him, to find out what was the matter. I assumed an unconcern I did not
      <span class="pagenum">31</span><a name="link31" id="link31"></a> feel for
      I was really both provoked and sorry, foreseeing what a breach this folly
      must make in the comfort of my Windsor expeditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down a little aloof, and entered into no conversation all the
      evening; but just as tea was over, the hunt of the next being mentioned he
      suddenly, asked Miss Planta to request leave for him of the queen to ride
      out with the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not see the queen,&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;you had much
      better ask Miss Burney.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was very awkward. I was in no humour to act for him at this time, nor
      could he muster courage to desire it; but upon Miss Planta&rsquo;s looking
      at each of us with some surprise, and repeating her amendment to his
      proposal, he faintly said, &ldquo;Would Miss Burney be so good as to take
      that trouble?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An opportunity offering favourably, I spoke at night to the queen, and she
      gave leave for his attending the chase. I intended to send this permission
      to Miss Planta, but I had scarce returned to my own room from her majesty,
      before a rap at my door was followed by his appearance. He stood quite
      aloof, looking grave and contrite. I Immediately called out &ldquo;I have
      spoken, sir, to the queen, and you have her leave to go.&rdquo; He bowed
      very profoundly, and thanked me, and was retreating, but came back again,
      and advancing, assumed an air of less humility, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Allons
      donc, Mademoiselle, j&rsquo;espère que vous n'êtes plus si méchante qu&rsquo;hier
      au soir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I said nothing; he came nearer, and, bowing upon his own hand, held it out
      for mine, with a look of most respectful Supplication. I had no intention
      of cutting the matter so short, yet from shame to sustain resentment, I
      was compelled to hold out a finger: he took it with a look of great
      gratitude, and very reverently touching the tip of my glove with his lip,
      instantly let it go, and very solemnly said, &ldquo;Soyez sûr que je n&rsquo;ai
      jamais eu la moindre idée de vous offenser.&rdquo; and then he thanked me
      again for his licence, and went his way.

    <h2>
      A SURPRISE AT THE PLAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had the pleasure of two or three visits from Mr. Bryant, whose loyal
      regard for the king and queen makes him eagerly accept every invitation,
      from the hope of seeing them in my room; and one of the days they both
      came in to speak to him, and were accompanied by the two eldest
      princesses, who stood<span class="pagenum">32</span><a name="link32"
      id="link32"></a> chatting with me by the door the whole time, and saying
      comical things upon royal personages in tragedies, particularly Princess
      Augusta, who has a great deal of sport in her disposition. She very
      gravely asserted she thought some of those princes on the stage looked
      really quite as well as some she knew off it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once about this time I went to a play myself, which surely I may live long
      enough and never forget. It was &ldquo;Seduction,&rdquo; a very clever
      piece, but containing a dreadful picture of vice and dissipation in high
      life, written by Mr. Miles Andrews, with an epilogue&mdash;O, such an
      epilogue! I was listening to it with uncommon attention, from a compliment
      paid in it to Mrs. Montagu, among other female writers; but imagine what
      became of my attention when I suddenly was struck with these lines, or
      something like them:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Let sweet Cecilia gain your just applause,
     Whose every passion yields to Reason&rsquo;s laws.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      To hear, wholly unprepared and unsuspicious, such lines in a theatre&mdash;seated
      in a royal box&mdash;and with the whole royal family and their suite
      immediately opposite me&mdash;was it not a singular circumstance? To
      describe my embarrassment would be impossible. My whole head was leaning
      forward, with my opera glass in my hand, examining Miss Farren, who spoke
      the epilogue. Instantly I shrank back, so astonished and so ashamed of my
      public situation, that I was almost ready to take to my heels and run, for
      it seemed as if I were there purposely in that conspicuous place&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To list attentive to my own applause.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The king immediately raised his opera-glass to look at me, laughing
      heartily&mdash;the queen&rsquo;s presently took the same direction&mdash;all
      the princesses looked up, and all the attendants, and all the maids of
      honour!
    </p>
    <p>
      I protest I was never more at a loss what to do with myself: nobody was in
      the front row with me but Miss Goldsworthy, who instantly seeing how I was
      disconcerted, prudently and good-naturedly forbore taking any notice of
      me. I sat as far back as I could, and kept my fan against the exposed
      profile for the rest of the night, never once leaning forward, nor using
      my glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of the royal family spoke to me on this matter till a few days after;
      but I heard from Mrs. Delany they had all declared<span class="pagenum">33</span><a
      name="link33" id="link33"></a> themselves sorry for the confusion it had
      caused me. And some time after the queen could not forbear saying, &ldquo;I
      hope, Miss Burney, YOU minded the epilogue the other night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the king, very comically, said, &ldquo;I took a peep at you!&mdash;I
      could not help that. I wanted to see how you looked when your father first
      discovered your writing&mdash;and now I think I know!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE KING&rsquo;S BIRTHDAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      St. James&rsquo;s Palace, June 4-Take a little of the humours of this day,
      with respect to myself, as they have arisen. I quitted my downy pillow at
      half-past six o&rsquo;clock, for bad habits in sickness have lost me half
      an hour of every morning; and then, according to an etiquette I discovered
      but on Friday night, I was quite new dressed: for I find that, on the king&rsquo;s
      birthday, and on the queen&rsquo;s, both real and nominal, two new
      attires, one half, the other full dressed, are expected from all
      attendants that come into the royal presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This first labour was happily achieved in such good time, that I was just
      seated to my breakfast&mdash;a delicate bit of roll half-eaten, and a
      promising dish of tea well stirred&mdash;when I received my summons to
      attend the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was only with her wardrobe-woman, and accepted most graciously a
      little murmuring congratulation upon the day, which I ventured to whisper
      while she looked another way. Fortunately for me, she is always quick in
      conceiving what is meant, and never wastes time in demanding what is said.
      She told me she had bespoke Miss Planta to attend at the grand toilette at
      St. James&rsquo;s, as she saw my strength still diminished by my late
      illness. Indeed it still is, though in all other respects I am perfectly
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen wore a very beautiful dress, of a new manufacture, of worked
      muslin, thin, fine, and clear, as the chambery gauze. I attended her from
      the blue closet, in which she dresses, through the rooms that lead to the
      breakfast apartment. In One of these while she stopped for her
      hair-dresser to finish her head-dress, the king joined her. She spoke to
      him in German, and he kissed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three elder princesses came in soon after: they all went up, with
      congratulatory smiles and curtsies, to their royal father, who kissed them
      very affectionately; they then, as usual every Morning, kissed the queen&rsquo;s
      hand. The door was thrown open <span class="pagenum">34</span><a
      name="link34" id="link34"></a> to the breakfast-room, which is a noble
      apartment, fitted up with some of Vandyke&rsquo;s best works; and the
      instant the king, who led the way, entered, I was surprised by a sudden
      sound of music, and found that a band of musicians were stationed there to
      welcome him. The princesses followed, but Princess Elizabeth turned round
      to me to say she could hardly bear the sound: it was the first morning of
      her coming down to breakfast for many months, as she had had that repast
      in her own room ever since her dangerous illness. It overcame her, she
      said, more than the dressing, more than the early rising, more than the
      whole of the hurry and fatigue of all the rest of a public birthday. She
      loves the king most tenderly; and there is a something in receiving any
      person who is loved, by sudden music, that I can easily conceive to be
      very trying to the nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Princess Augusta came back to cheer and counsel her; she begged her to
      look out at the window, to divert her thoughts, and said she would place
      her where the sound might be less affecting to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lively &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, Miss Burney? I hope you are quite well
      now?&rdquo; from the sweet Princess Mary, who was entering the ante-room,
      made me turn from her two charming sisters; she passed on to the
      breakfast, soon followed by Princess Sophia, and then a train of their
      governesses, Miss Goldsworthy, Mademoiselle Montmoulin, and Miss Gomme,
      all in full dress, with fans. We reciprocated little civilities, and I had
      then the pleasure to see little Princess Amelia, with Mrs. Cheveley, who
      brought up the rear. Never, in tale or fable, were there six sister
      princesses more lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I had been extremely distressed upon the queen&rsquo;s birthday, in
      January, where to go or how to act, and could obtain no information from
      my coadjutrix, I now resolved to ask for directions from the queen
      herself; and she readily gave them, in a manner to make this day far more
      comfortable to me than the last. She bade me dress as fast as I could, and
      go to St. James&rsquo;, by eleven o&rsquo;clock; but first come into the
      room to her. Then followed my grand toilette. The hair-dresser was waiting
      for me, and he went to work first, and I second, with all our might and
      main. When my adorning tasks were accomplished, I went to the blue closet.
      No one was there, I then hesitated whether to go back or seek the queen. I
      have a dislike insuperable to entering a royal presence, except by an<span
      class="pagenum">35</span><a name="link35" id="link35"></a> immediate
      Summons: however, the directions I had had prevailed, and I went into the
      adjoining apartment. There stood Madame de la Fite! she was talking in a
      low voice with M. de Luc. They told me the queen was in the next room, and
      on I went.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was seated at a glass, and the hair-dresser was putting on her jewels,
      while a clergyman in his canonicals was standing near and talking to her.
      I imagined him some bishop unknown to me, and stopped; the queen looked
      round, and called out &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Miss Burney!&mdash;come in, Miss
      Burney.&rdquo; in I came, curtseying respectfully to a bow from the
      canonicals, but I found not out till he answered something said by the
      queen, that it was no other than Mr. Turbulent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de la Fite then presented herself at the door (which was open for
      air) of the ante-room. The queen bowed to her, and said she would see her
      presently: she retired, and her majesty, in a significant low voice, said
      to me, &ldquo;Do go to her, and keep her there a little!&rdquo; I obeyed,
      and being now in no fright nor hurry, entered into conversation with her
      sociably and comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then went to St. James&rsquo;s. The queen was most brilliant in attire;
      and when she was arrayed, Mr. West<a href="#linknote-233"
      name="linknoteref-233" id="linknoteref-233"><small>233</small></a> was
      allowed to enter the dressing-room, in order to give his opinion of the
      disposition-of her jewels, which indeed were arranged with great taste and
      effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three princesses, Princess Royal, Augusta, and Elizabeth, were all
      very splendidly decorated, and looked beautiful. They are indeed
      uncommonly handsome, each in their different Way-the princess royal for
      figure, the Princess Augusta for countenance, and the Princess Elizabeth
      for face.

    <h2>
      THE EQUERRIES: COLONEL MANNERS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Friday, June 8-This day we came to Windsor for the Summer, during which we
      only go to town for a Drawing-room once a fortnight, and to Kew in the
      way. Mrs. Schwellenberg remained in town, not well enough to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house now was quite full, the king having ordered a party to it for
      the Whitsun holidays. This party was Colonel <span class="pagenum">37</span><a
      name="link37" id="link37"></a> Manners, the equerry in waiting; Colonel
      Ramsden, a good-humoured and well-bred old officer of the king&rsquo;s
      household; Colonels Wellbred and Goldsworthy, and General Budé.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Ramsden is gentle and pleasing, but very silent; General Budé is
      always cheerful, but rises not above a second; Colonel Hotham has a
      shyness that looks haughty, and therefore distances; Colonel Goldsworthy
      reserves his sport and humour for particular days and particular
      favourites; and Colonel Wellbred draws back into himself unless the
      conversation promises either instruction or quiet pleasure; nor would any
      one of these, during the whole time, speak at all, but to a next
      neighbour, nor even then, except when that neighbour suited his fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must not, however, imagine we had no public speakers; M. del Campo
      harangued aloud to whoever was willing to listen, and Colonel Manners did
      the same, without even waiting for that proviso. Colonel Manners, however,
      I must introduce to you by a few specimens: he is so often, in common with
      all the equerries, to appear on the scene, that I wish you to make a
      particular acquaintance with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, when we were all, as usual, assembled, he began a discourse
      upon the conclusion of his waiting, which finishes with the end of June:&mdash;&ldquo;Now
      I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s well managed:
      here we&rsquo;re all in waiting for three months at a time, and then for
      nine months there&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cry your mercy!&rdquo; cried Colonel Goldsworthy, &ldquo;if three
      months&mdash;three whole months&mdash;are not enough for you, pray take a
      few more from mine to make up your market!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I don&rsquo;t mean that;&mdash;but why can&rsquo;t we have
      our waitings month by month?&mdash;would not that be better?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not!&mdash;we should then have no time unbroken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but would not that be better than what it is now? Why, we&rsquo;re
      here so long, that when one goes away nobody knows one!&mdash;one has
      quite to make a new acquaintance! Why, when I first come out of waiting, I
      never know where to find anybody!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ascot races were held at this time; the royal family were to be at
      them one or two of the days. Colonel Manners earnestly pressed Miss Port
      to be there. Colonel Goldsworthy said it was quite immaterial to him who
      was there, for when he was attending royalty he never presumed to think of
      any private comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see that!&rdquo; cried Colonel Manners,&mdash;&ldquo;for
      if<span class="pagenum">37</span><a name="link37" id="link37_"></a> I was
      you, and not in my turn for waiting, I should go about just as I liked;&mdash;but
      now, as for me, as it happens to be my own turn, Why I think it right to
      be civil to the king.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We all looked round;&mdash;but Colonel Goldsworthy broke forth aloud&mdash;
      &ldquo;Civil, quotha?&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;Ha! ha! civil, forsooth!&mdash;You&rsquo;re
      mighty condescending!&mdash;the first equerry I ever heard talk of his
      civility to the king!&mdash;&lsquo;Duty,&rsquo; and &lsquo;respect,&rsquo;
      and &lsquo;humble reverence,&rsquo;&mdash;those are words we are used to,&mdash;but
      here come you with Your civility!&mdash;&mdash;Commend me to such
      affability!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      You see he is not spared; but Colonel Goldsworthy is the wag professed of
      their community, and privileged to say what he pleases. The other, with
      the most perfect good-humour, accepted the joke, without dreaming of
      taking offence at the sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another evening the king sent for Colonel Ramsden to play at backgammon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy, happy man!&rdquo; exclaimed Colonel Goldsworthy, exultingly;
      but scarce had he uttered the words ere he was summoned to follow himself.
      &ldquo;What! already!&rdquo; cried he,&mdash;&ldquo;without even my tea!
      Why this is worse and worse!&mdash;no peace in Israel!&mdash;only one half
      hour allowed for comfort, and now that&rsquo;s swallowed! Well, I must go;&mdash;make
      my complaints aside, and my bows and smiles in full face!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Off he went, but presently, in a great rage, came back, and, while he
      drank a hot dish of tea which I instantly presented him, kept railing at
      his stars for ever bringing him under a royal roof. &ldquo;If it had not
      been for a puppy,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I had never got off even to
      scald my throat in this manner But they&rsquo;ve just got a dear little
      new ugly dog: so one puppy gave Way to t&rsquo;other, and I just left them
      to kiss and hug it, while I stole off to drink this tea! But this is too
      much!&mdash;no peace for a moment!&mdash;no peace in Israel!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When this was passed, Colonel Wellbred renewed some of the conversation of
      the preceding day with me; and, just as he named Dr. Herschel Colonel
      Manners broke forth with his dissenting opinions. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      give up to Dr. Herschel at all,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;he is all system;
      and so they are all: and if they can but make out their systems, they don&rsquo;t
      care a pin for anything else. As to Herschel, I liked him well enough till
      he came to his volcanoes in the moon, and then I gave him up, I saw he was
      just like the rest. How should he know anything Of the matter? There&rsquo;s
      no such thing as pretending to measure, at such a distance as that?"<span
      class="pagenum">38</span><a name="link38" id="link38"></a> Colonel
      Wellbred, to whom I looked for an answer, instead of making any, waited in
      quiet silence till he had exhausted all he had to say upon the subject,
      and then, turning to me, made some inquiry about the Terrace, and went on
      to other general matters. But, some time after, when all were engaged, and
      this topic seemed quite passed, he calmly began, in general terms, to
      lament that the wisest and best of people were always so little honoured
      or understood in their own time, and added that he had no doubt but Sir
      Isaac Newton had been as much scoffed and laughed at formerly as Herschel
      was now; but concluded, in return, Herschel, hereafter, would be as highly
      reverenced as Sir Isaac was at present....
    </p>
    <p>
      We had then some discourse upon dress and fashions. Virtuosos being next
      named, Colonel Manners inveighed against them quite violently, protesting
      they all wanted common honour and honesty; and to complete the happy
      subject, he instanced, in particular, Sir William Hamilton, who, he
      declared, had absolutely robbed both the king and state of Naples!
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, somebody related that, upon the heat in the air being
      mentioned to Dr. Heberden, he had answered that he supposed it proceeded
      from the last eruption in the volcano in the moon: &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; cried
      Colonel Manners, &ldquo;I suppose he knows as much of the matter as the
      rest of them: if you put a candle at the end of a telescope, and let him
      look at it, he&rsquo;ll say, what an eruption there is in the moon! I mean
      if Dr. Herschel would do it to him; I don&rsquo;t say he would think so
      from such a person as me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Bryant himself has seen this volcano from the telescope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t mind Mr. Bryant any more than Dr. Heberden: he&rsquo;s
      just as credulous as t&rsquo;other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to ask by what criterion he settled these points in so superior a
      manner:&mdash;but I thought it best to imitate the silence of Colonel
      Wellbred, who constantly called a new subject, upon every pause, to avoid
      all argument and discussion while the good-humoured Colonel Manners was
      just as ready to start forward in the new subject, as he had been in that
      which had been set aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      One other evening I invited Madame de la Fite: but it did not prove the
      same thing; they have all a really most undue dislike of her, and shirk
      her conversation and fly to one another, to discourse on hunting and
      horses.<span class="pagenum">39</span><a name="link39" id="link39"></a>
      THE DUCHESS DE POLIGNAC AT WINDSOR.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following Sunday, June 17, I was tempted to go on the Terrace, in
      order to see the celebrated Madame de Polignac,<a href="#linknote-234"
      name="linknoteref-234" id="linknoteref-234"><small>234</small></a> and her
      daughter, Madame de Guiche. They were to be presented, with the Duke de
      Polignac, to their majesties, upon the Terrace. Their rank entitled them
      to this distinction; and the Duchess of Ancaster, to whom they had been
      extremely courteous abroad, came to Windsor to introduce them. They were
      accompanied to the Terrace by Mrs. Harcourt and the general &lsquo;with
      whom they were also well acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to the place of rendezvous at six o&rsquo;clock; the royal party
      followed about seven, and was very brilliant upon the occasion. The king
      and queen led the way, and the Prince of Wales, who came purposely to
      honour the interview, appeared at it also, in the king&rsquo;s Windsor
      uniform. Lady Weymouth was in waiting upon the queen. The Duchess of
      Ancaster, Lady Charlotte Bertie, and Lady Elizabeth Waldegrave, with some
      other ladies, I think, attended: but the two eldest princesses, to the
      very great detriment of the scenery, were ill, and remained at home.
      Princess Elizabeth and Mary were alone in the queen&rsquo;s suite.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went with Miss Port and Mrs. and Miss Heberden. The crowd was so great,
      it was difficult to move. Their majesties and their train occupied a large
      space, and their attendants<span class="pagenum">40</span><a name="link40"
      id="link40"></a> had no easy task in keeping them from being incommoded by
      the pressing of the people. They stopped to converse with these noble
      travellers for more than an hour. Madame la Duchesse de Polignac is a very
      well-looking woman, and Madame de Guiche is very pretty. There were other
      ladies and gentlemen in their party. But I was much amused by their dress,
      which they meant should be entirely a l&rsquo;Angloise&mdash;for which
      purpose they had put on plain undress gowns, with close ordinary black
      silk bonnets! I am sure they must have been quite confused when they saw
      the queen and princesses, with their ladies, who were all dressed with
      uncommon care, and very splendidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was glad, at least, they should all witness, and report, the
      reconciliation of the king and the Prince of Wales, who frequently spoke
      together, and were both in good spirits.

    <h2>
      COLONEL MANNERS&rsquo; MUSICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Port and myself had, afterwards, an extremely risible evening with
      Colonels Goldsworthy, Wellbred, and Manners the rest were summoned away to
      the king, or retired to their own apartments. Colonel Wellbred began the
      sport, undesignedly, by telling me something new relative to Dr. Herschel&rsquo;s
      volcanoes. This was enough for Colonel Manners, who declared aloud his
      utter contempt for such pretended discoveries. He was deaf to all that
      could be said in answer, and protested he wondered how any man of common
      sense could ever listen to such a pack of stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. de Luc&rsquo;s opinion upon the subject being then mentioned&mdash;he
      exclaimed, very disdainfully, &ldquo;O, as to Mr. de Luc, he&rsquo;s
      another man for a system himself, and I&rsquo;d no more trust him than
      anybody: if you was only to make a little bonfire, and put it upon a hill
      a little way off, you might make him take it for a volcano directly!&mdash;And
      Herschel&rsquo;s not a bit better. Those sort of philosophers are the
      easiest taken in in the world.&rdquo; Our next topic was still more
      ludicrous. Colonel Manners asked me if I had not heard something, very
      harmonious at church in the morning? I answered I was too far off, if he
      meant from himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I was singing with Colonel Wellbred;
      and he said he was my second.&mdash;How did I do that song?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Song?&mdash;Mercy!&rdquo; exclaimed Colonel Goldsworthy, &ldquo;a
      song at church!&mdash;why it was the 104th Psalm!&rdquo;<span
      class="pagenum">41</span><a name="link41" id="link41"></a> &ldquo;But how
      did I do it, Wellbred; for I never tried at it before?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;pretty well,&rdquo; answered Colonel Wellbred, very
      composedly; &ldquo;Only now and then you run me a little into &lsquo;God
      save the king.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This dryness discomposed every muscle but of Colonel Manners, who replied,
      with great simplicity, &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s the
      tune I know best!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;&rsquo;twas a happy mistake to
      make so near their majesties.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, pray, now, Colonel Wellbred, tell me sincerely&mdash;could you
      really make out what I was singing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; answered Colonel Wellbred; &ldquo;with the words.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but pray, now, what do you call my voice?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a counter-tenor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and is that a good voice?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no resisting,-even the quiet Colonel Wellbred could not resist
      laughing out here. But Colonel Manners, quite at his ease, continued his
      self-discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do think, now, if I was to have a person to play over a thing to
      me again and again, and then let me sing it, and stop me every time I was
      wrong, I do think I should be able to sing &lsquo;God save the king&rsquo;
      as well as some ladies do, that have always people to show them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a good chance then here,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;of singing
      some pieces of Handel, for I am sure you hear them again and again!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but that is not the thing for though I hear them do it&rsquo;
      so often over, they don&rsquo;t stop for me to sing it after them, and
      then to set me right. Now I&rsquo;ll try if you&rsquo;ll know what this
      is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He then began humming aloud, &ldquo;My soul praise,&rdquo; etc., so very
      horribly, that I really found all decorum at an end, and laughed, with
      Miss Port, a qui mieux mieux. Too much engaged to mind this, he very
      innocently, when he had done, applied to us all round for our opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Port begged him to sing another, and asked for that he had spouted
      the other day, &ldquo;Care, thou bane of love and joy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He instantly complied; and went on, in such shocking, discordant and
      unmeaning sounds, that nothing in a farce could be more risible: in
      defiance however of all interruptions, he Continued till he had finished
      one stanza; when Colonel Goldsworthy loudly called out,&mdash;&ldquo;There,&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      enough!&mdash;have mercy!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">42</span><a
      name="link42" id="link42"></a> &ldquo;Well, then, now I&rsquo;ll try
      something else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no!&rdquo; cried Colonel Goldsworthy, hastily, &ldquo;thank you,
      thank you for this,-but I won&rsquo;t trouble you for more&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      not bear another word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Wellbred then, with an affected seriousness, begged to know, since
      he took to singing, what he should do for a shake, which was absolutely
      indispensable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A shake?&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;a shake with the voice, such as singers make.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how must I do it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, really, I cannot tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, I&rsquo;ll try myself&mdash;is it so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he began such a harsh hoarse noise, that Colonel Goldsworthy
      exclaimed, between every other sound,&mdash;&ldquo;No, no,&mdash;no more!&rdquo;
      While Colonel Wellbred professed teaching him, and gave such ridiculous
      lessons and directions,-now to stop short, now to swell,-now to sink the
      voice, etc., etc., that, between the master and the scholar, we were
      almost demolished.

    <h2>
      MRS. SCHWELLENBERG&rsquo;S &ldquo;LUMP OF LEATHER.&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tuesday, June 19.&mdash;We were scarcely all arranged at tea when Colonel
      Manners eagerly said, &ldquo;Pray, Mrs. Schwellenberg, have you lost
      anything?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&mdash;no, not I
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&mdash;what, nothing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, that&rsquo;s very odd! for I found something that had
      your name writ upon it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name? and where did you find that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;it was something I found in my bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your bed?&mdash;O, very well! that is reelly comeecal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray what was it?&rdquo; cried Miss Port.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;a great large, clumsy lump of leather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of leadder, sir?&mdash;of leadder? What was that for me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am, it was so big and so heavy, it was as much as I
      could do to lift it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that was nothing from me! when it was so heavy, you might let
      it alone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, ma&rsquo;am, Colonel Wellbred said it was somewhat of yours."<span
      class="pagenum">43</span><a name="link43" id="link43"></a> &ldquo;Of mine?&mdash;O,
      ver well! Colonel Wellbred might not say such thing! I know nothing, Sir,
      from your leadder, nor from your bed, sir,&mdash;not I!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, then your maid does. Colonel Wellbred says he
      supposes it was she.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my vord! Colonel Wellbred might not say such things from my
      maid! I won&rsquo;t not have it so!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes, ma&rsquo;am; Colonel Wellbred says she often does SO. He
      says she&rsquo;s a very gay lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quite too much amazed to speak: one of her maids, Mrs. Arline, is
      a poor humble thing, that would not venture to jest, I believe, with the
      kitchen maid, and the other has never before been at Windsor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what was it?&rdquo; cried Miss Port.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I tell you&mdash;a great, large lump of leather, with &lsquo;Madame
      Schwellenberg&rsquo; wrote upon it. However, I&rsquo;ve ordered it to be
      sold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sold? How will you have it sold, Sir? You might tell me that,
      when you please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, by auction, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By auction, Sir? What, when it had my name upon it? Upon my vord!&mdash;how
      come you to do dat, sir? Will you tell me, once?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I did it for the benefit of my man, ma&rsquo;am, that he might
      have the money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for what is your man to have it, when it is mine?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, ma&rsquo;am, it frightened him so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over well! Do you rob, sir? Do you take what is not your own, but
      others&rsquo;, sir, because your man is frightened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes, ma&rsquo;am! We military men take all we can get!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! in the king&rsquo;s house, Sir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then, ma&rsquo;am, what business had it in my bed? My room&rsquo;s
      my castle: nobody has a right there. My bed must be my treasury; and here
      they put me a thing into it big enough to be a bed itself.&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! vell! (much alarmed) it might be my bed-case, then!&rdquo;
      (Whenever Mrs. Schwellenberg travels, she carries her bed in a large black
      leather case, behind her servants&rsquo; carriage.) &ldquo;Very likely, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; very angrily, &ldquo;how come you by it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll tell you, ma&rsquo;am. I was just going to bed; so
      MY servant took one candle, and I had the other. I had just had my hair
      done, and my curls were just rolled up, and he<span class="pagenum">44</span><a
      name="link44" id="link44"></a> was going away; but I turned about, by
      accident, and I saw a great lump in my bed; so I thought it was my
      clothes. &lsquo;What do you put them there for?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo;
      says he, &lsquo;it looks as if there was a drunken man in the bed.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;A drunken man?&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;Take the poker, then, and
      knock him on the head!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knock him on the head?&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Schwellenberg,
      &ldquo;What! when it might be some innocent person? Fie! Colonel Manners.
      I thought you had been too good-natured for such thing&mdash;to poker the
      people in the king&rsquo;s house!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what business have they to get into my bed, ma&rsquo;am? So
      then my man looked nearer, and he said, &lsquo;Sir, why, here&rsquo;s your
      night-cap and here&rsquo;s the pillow!&mdash;and here&rsquo;s a great,
      large lump of leather!&rsquo; &lsquo;Shovel it all out!&rsquo; says I.
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Madame Schwellenberg&rsquo;s!
      here&rsquo;s her name on it.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; says I,
      &lsquo;sell it, to-morrow, to the saddler.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! when you knew it was mine, sir? Upon my vord, you been ver
      good!&rdquo; (bowing very low). &ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, it&rsquo;s all
      Colonel Wellbred, I dare say; so, suppose you and I were to take the law
      of him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, sir!&rdquo; (Scornfully).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but let&rsquo;s write him a letter, then, and frighten him:
      let&rsquo;s tell him it&rsquo;s sold, and he must make it good. You and I&rsquo;ll
      do it together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; you might do it yourself. I am not so familiar to write to
      gentlemens.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then, you shall only sign it, and I&rsquo;ll frank it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the entrance of some new person stopped the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy in his success, he began, the next day, a new device: he made an
      attack in politics, and said, he did not doubt but Mr. Hastings would come
      to be hanged; though, he assured us, afterwards, he was firmly his friend,
      and believed no such thing.<a href="#linknote-236" name="linknoteref-236"
      id="linknoteref-236"><small>236</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Even with this not satisfied, he next told her that he had just heard Mr.
      Burke was in Windsor. Mr. Burke is the name<span class="pagenum">45</span><a
      name="link45" id="link45"></a> in the world most obnoxious, both for his
      Reform bill,<a href="#linknote-237" name="linknoteref-237"
      id="linknoteref-237"><small>237</small></a> which deeply affected all the
      household, and for his prosecution of Mr. Hastings; she therefore
      declaimed against him very warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you like to know him, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Me?&mdash;No;
      not I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, I dare say, ma&rsquo;am, I have interest enough with him
      to procure you his acquaintance. Shall I bring him to the Lodge to see
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you please, sir, you might keep him to yourself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, he shall come and dine with me, and after it drink tea
      with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not I! You might have him all to yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he comes, you must make his tea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no such &lsquo;must,&rsquo; sir! I do it for my pleasure&mdash;only
      when I please, sir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At night, when we were separating, he whispered Miss Port that he had
      something else in store for the next meeting, when he intended to
      introduce magnetising.

    <h2>
      MRS. SCHWELLENBERG&rsquo;s FROGS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      July 2.&mdash;What a stare was drawn from our new equerry<a
      href="#linknote-238" name="linknoteref-238" id="linknoteref-238"><small>238</small></a>
      by Major Price&rsquo;s gravely asking Mrs. Schwellenberg, after the health
      of her frogs? She answered they were very well, and the major said,
      &ldquo;You must know, Colonel Gwynn, Mrs. Schwellenberg keeps a pair of
      frogs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of frogs?&mdash;pray what do they feed upon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flies, sir,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, ma&rsquo;am, what food have they in winter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stare was now still wider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can make them croak when I will,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;when
      I only go so to my snuff-box, knock, knock, knock, they croak all what I
      please."<span class="pagenum">46</span><a name="link46" id="link46"></a>
      &ldquo;Very pretty, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Colonel Goldsworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought to have some spawn,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;but then
      Maria Carlton, what you call Lady Doncaster, came and frightened them; I
      was never so angry!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for that,&rdquo; cried the major, very seriously,
      &ldquo;for else I should have begged a pair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you meant, ma&rsquo;am, to have had a breed of them,&rdquo;
      cried Colonel Goldsworthy; &ldquo;a breed of young frogs? Vastly clever,
      indeed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a formal enumeration of their virtues and endearing little
      qualities, which made all laugh except the new equerry, who sat in perfect
      amaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, suddenly, she stopped short, and called out, &ldquo;There! now I
      have told you all this, you might tell something to me. I have talked
      enoff; now you might amuse me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      July 19.&mdash;In the afternoon, while I was working in Mrs. Schwellenberg&rsquo;s
      room, Mr. Turbulent entered, to summon Miss Planta to the princesses; and,
      in the little while of executing that simple commission, he made such use
      of his very ungovernable and extraordinary eyes, that the moment he was
      gone, Mrs. Schwellenberg demanded &ldquo;for what he looked so at me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I desired to know what she meant. &ldquo;Why, like when he was so cordial
      with you? Been you acquainted?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes!&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;I spent three hours twice a-week
      upon the road with him and Miss Planta, all the winter; and three or four
      dinners and afternoons besides.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O that&rsquo;s nothing! that&rsquo;s no acquaintance at all. I have
      had people to me, to travel and to dine, fourteen and fifteen years, and
      yet they been never so cordial!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was too unanswerable for reply; but it determined me to try at some
      decided measure for restraining or changing looks and behaviour that
      excited such comments. And I thought my safest way would be fairly and
      frankly to tell him this very inquiry. It might put him upon his guard
      from such foolishness, without any more serious effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      July 20.&mdash;This evening Mrs. Schwellenberg was not well, and sent to
      desire I would receive the gentlemen to tea, and make her apologies. I
      immediately summoned my lively, and lovely young companion, Miss Port, who
      hastens at every call with good-humoured delight.<span class="pagenum">47</span><a
      name="link47" id="link47"></a> We had really a pleasant evening, though
      simply from the absence of spleen and jealousy, which seemed to renew and
      invigorate the spirits of all present: namely, General Budé, Signor del
      Campo, and Colonel Gwynn. They all stayed very late but when they made
      their exit, I dismissed my gay assistant and thought it incumbent on me to
      show myself upstairs; a reception was awaiting me!&mdash;so grim! But,
      what O heaven! how depressing, how cruel, to be fastened thus on an
      associate so exigeante, so tyrannical, and so ill-disposed!
    </p>
    <p>
      I feared to blame the equerries for having detained me, as they were
      already so much out of favour. I only, therefore, mentioned M. del Campo,
      who, as a foreign minister, might be allowed so much civility as not to be
      left to himself: for I was openly reproachedthat I had not quitted them to
      hasten to her! Nothing, however, availed; and after vainly trying to
      appease her, I was obliged to go to my own room, to be in attendance for
      my royal summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      July 21.&mdash;I resolved to be very meek and patient, as I do, now and
      then, when I am good, and to bear this hard trial of causeless offence
      without resentment; and, therefore, I went this afternoon as soon as I had
      dined, and sat and worked, and forced conversation, and did my best, but
      with very indifferent success; when, most perversely, who should be again
      announced-but Mr. Turbulent. As I believe the visit was not, just after
      those &ldquo;cordial&rdquo; looks, supposed to be solely for the lady of
      the apartment, his reception was no better than mine had been the
      preceding days! He did not, however, regard it, but began a talk, in which
      he made it his business to involve me, by perpetual reference to my
      opinion. This did not much conciliate matters; and his rebuffs, from time
      to time, were so little ceremonious, that nothing but the most confirmed
      contempt could have kept off an angry resentment. I could sometimes
      scarcely help laughing at his utterly careless returns to an imperious
      haughtiness, vainly meant to abash and distance him. I took the earliest
      moment in my power to quit the room and the reproach with which he looked
      at my exit, for leaving him to such a tête-à-tête, was quite risible. He
      knew he could not, in decency, run away immediately, to and he seemed
      ready to commit some desperate act for having drawn himself into such a
      difficulty. I am always rejoiced when his flights and follies bring their
      own punishment.<span class="pagenum">48</span><a name="link48" id="link48"></a>
      MR. TURBULENT&rsquo;S ANTICS.
    </p>
    <p>
      July 25&mdash;Mr. Turbulent amused himself this morning with giving me yet
      another panic. He was ordered to attend the queen during her
      hair-dressing, as was Mr. de Luc. I remained in the room the queen
      conversed with us all three, as occasions arose, with the utmost
      complacency; but this person, instead of fixing there his sole attention,
      contrived, by standing behind her chair, and facing me, to address a
      language of signs to me the whole time, casting up his eyes, clasping his
      hands, and placing himself in various fine attitudes, and all with a
      humour so burlesque, that it was impossible to take it either ill or
      seriously. Indeed, when I am on the very point of the most alarmed

    <h2>
      MEETING OF THE TWO PRINCES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      To-day, after a seven years&rsquo; absence, arrived the Duke of York. I
      saw him alight from his carriage, with an eagerness, a vivacity, that
      assured me of the affectionate joy with which he returned to his country
      and family. But the joy of his excellent father!-O, that there is no
      describing. It was the glee of the first youth&mdash;nay, of an ardent and
      innocent infancy,&mdash;so pure it seemed, so warm, so open, so unmixed!
      Softer joy was the queen&rsquo;s&mdash;mild, equal, and touching while all
      the princesses were in one universal rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      To have the pleasure of seeing the royal family in this happy assemblage,
      I accompanied Miss Port on the Terrace. It was indeed an affecting sight
      to view the general content; but that of the king went to my very heart,
      so delighted he looked-so proud Of his son&mdash;so benevolently pleased
      that every one should witness his satisfaction. The Terrace was very full;
      all Windsor and its neighbourhood poured in upon it, to see the prince
      whose whole demeanour seemed promising to merit his flattering reception&mdash;gay
      yet grateful&mdash;modest, yet unembarrassed......
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning arrived the Prince of Wales, who had travelled all
      night from Brighthelmstone. The day was a day Of complete happiness to the
      whole of the royal family; the king was in one transport of delight,
      unceasing, invariable;<span class="pagenum">50</span><a name="link50"
      id="link50"></a> and though the newly-arrived duke was its source and
      Support the kindness of his heart extended and expanded to his eldest&rsquo;
      born, whom he seemed ready again to take to his paternal breast; indeed,
      the whole world seemed endeared to him by the happiness he now felt in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday, Aug. 5.&mdash;General Grenville brought in the duke this evening
      to the tea-room. I was very much pleased with his behaviour, which was
      modest, dignified, and easy. Might he but escape the contagion of
      surrounding examples, he seems promising of all his fond father expects
      and merits....
    </p>
    <p>
      Kew, Aug. 7-The next day the now happy family had the delight of again
      seeing the two princes in its circle. They dined here; and the Princess
      Augusta, who came to Mrs. Schwellenberg&rsquo;s room in the evening, on a
      message, said, &ldquo;There never had been so happy a dinner since the
      world was created,&rdquo; The king, In the evening, again drove out the
      queen and princesses. The Prince of Wales, seeing Mr. Smelt in our room
      (which, at Kew, is in the front of the house, as well as at Windsor), said
      he would come in and ask him how he did. Accordingly, in he came, and
      talked to Mr. Smelt for about a quarter of an hour; his subjects almost
      wholly his horses and his rides. He gave some account of his expedition to
      town to meet his brother. He was just preparing, at Brighton, to give a
      supper entertainment to Madame La Princesse de Lamballe,&mdash;when he
      perceived his courier. &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;my
      brother&rsquo;s come!&rdquo; set off instantly to excuse himself to the
      princess, and arrived at Windsor by the time of early prayers, at eight o&rsquo;clock
      the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day, again,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I resolved to be in town to
      meet my brother; we determined to dine somewhere together, but had not
      settled where; so hither we came. When I went last to Brighton, I rode one
      hundred and thirty miles, and then danced at the ball. I am going back
      directly; but I shall ride to Windsor again for the birthday, and shall
      stay there till my brother&rsquo;s, and then back on Friday. We are going
      now over the way: my brother wants to see the old mansion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince of Wales&rsquo;s house is exactly opposite to the Lodge
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke then came in, and bowed to every one present, very attentively;
      and presently after, they went over the way, arm in arm; and thence
      returned to town.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a long and painful discourse afterwards with Mr. Smelt, deeply
      interested in these young princes, upon the many dangers awaiting the
      newly-arrived, who seemed alike<span class="pagenum">51</span><a
      name="link51" id="link51"></a> unfitted and unsuspicious for encountering
      them. Mr. Smelt&rsquo;s heart ached as if he had been their parent, and
      the regard springing from his early and long care of them seemed all
      revived in his hopes and fears of what might ensue from this reunion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rejoiced at the public reconciliation with the Prince of Wales, which
      had taken place during my illness, and which gave the greater reason for
      hope that there might not now be a division!

    <h2>
      BUNBURY, THE CARICATURIST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Windsor, Aug. 14.&mdash;-General Budé came in, with two strangers, whom he
      introduced to us by the names of Bunbury and Crawfurd. I was very curious
      to know if this was the Bunbury;<a href="#linknote-239"
      name="linknoteref-239" id="linknoteref-239"><small>239</small></a> and I
      conjectured it could be no other. When Colonel Gwynn joined us, he
      proposed anew the introduction; but nothing passed to ascertain my
      surmise. The conversation was general And good-humoured, but without
      anything striking, or bespeaking character or genius. Almost the whole
      consisted of inquiries what to do, whither to go, and how to proceed;
      which, though natural and sensible for a new man, were undistinguished by
      any humour, or keenness of expression or manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crawfurd spoke not a word. He is a very handsome young man, just
      appointed equerry to the Duke of York.
    </p>
    <p>
      I whispered my inquiry to Colonel Gwynn as soon as I found an opportunity,
      and heard, &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;&rsquo;tis Harry Bunbury, sure enough!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So now we may all be caricatured at his leisure! He is made another of the
      equerries to the Duke. A man with such a turn, and with talents so
      inimitable in displaying it, was rather a dangerous character to be
      brought within a Court!
    </p>
    <p>
      Aug. 15.&mdash;My sole conversation this evening was with Mr. Bunbury, who
      drew a chair next mine, and chatted incessantly, with great good humour,
      and an avidity to discuss the subjects he started, which were all
      concerning plays and Players.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the voice of the Duke of York was heard, calling aloud for
      Colonel Goldsworthy. Off he ran. Mr. Bunbury laughed, but declared he
      would not take the hint: &ldquo;What,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;if I lose
      the beginning?<a href="#linknote-240" name="linknoteref-240"
      id="linknoteref-240"><small>240</small></a>&mdash;I think I know it pretty<span
      class="pagenum">52</span><a name="link52" id="link52"></a> well by heart&rsquo;-&rsquo;Why
      did I marry&rsquo; &lsquo;&ldquo;&mdash;And then he began to spout, and
      act, and rattle away, with all his might,-till the same voice called out
      &ldquo;Bunbury!&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be too late!&rdquo;&mdash;And off he
      flew, leaving his tea untasted&mdash;so eager had he been in discourse.

    <h2>
      MRS. SIDDONS PROVES DISAPPOINTING ON NEAR ACQUAINTANCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wednesday, Aug. 15.&mdash;Mrs. Schwellenberg&rsquo;s illness occasioned my
      attending the queen alone; and when my official business was ended, she
      graciously detained me, to read to me a new paper called &ldquo;Olla
      Podrida,&rdquo; which is now Publishing periodically. Nothing very bright&mdash;nothing
      very deficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon, while I was drinking coffee with Mrs. Schwellenberg,&mdash;or,
      rather, looking at it, since I rarely, swallow any,&mdash;her majesty came
      Into the room, and soon after a little German discourse with Mrs.
      Schwellenberg told me Mrs. Siddons had been ordered to the Lodge, to read
      a play, and desired I would receive her in my room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt a little queer in the office; I had only seen her twice or thrice,
      in large assemblies, at Miss Monckton&rsquo;s, and at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s,
      and never had been introduced to her, nor spoken with her. However, in
      this dead and tame life I now lead, such an interview was by no means
      undesirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had just got to the bottom of the stairs, when she entered the passage
      gallery. I took her into the tea-room, and endeavoured to make amends for
      former distance and taciturnity, by an open and cheerful reception. I had
      heard from sundry people (in old days) that she wished to make the
      acquaintance; but I thought it then one of too conspicuous a sort for the
      quietness I had so much difficulty to preserve in my ever increasing
      connections. Here all was changed; I received her by the queen&rsquo;s
      commands, and was perfectly well inclined to reap some pleasure from the
      meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, now that we came so near, I was much disappointed in my expectations.
      I know not if my dear Fredy has met with her in private, but I fancy
      approximation is not highly in her favour. I found her the heroine of a
      tragedy,&mdash;sublime, elevated, and solemn. In face and person truly
      noble and commanding; in manners quiet and stiff; in voice deep and
      dragging; and in conversation, formal, sententious, calm, and<span
      class="pagenum">53</span><a name="link53" id="link53"></a> dry. I expected
      her to have been all that is interesting; the delicacy and sweetness with
      which she seizes every opportunity to strike and to captivate upon the
      stage had persuaded me that her mind was formed with that peculiar
      susceptibility which, in different modes, must give equal powers to
      attract and to delight in common life. But I was very much mistaken. As a
      stranger I must have admired her noble appearance and beautiful
      countenance, and have regretted that nothing in her conversation kept pace
      with their promise and, as a celebrated actress I had still only to do the
      same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether fame and success have spoiled her, or whether she only possesses
      the skill of representing and embellishing materials with which she is
      furnished by others, I know not but still I remain disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was scarcely seated, and a little general discourse begun, before she
      told me&mdash;at once&mdash;that &ldquo;There was no part she had ever so
      much wished to act as that of Cecilia.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I made some little acknowledgment, and hurried to ask when she had seen
      Sir Joshua Reynolds, Miss Palmer, and others with whom I knew her
      acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play she was to read was &ldquo;The Provoked Husband.&rdquo; She
      appeared neither alarmed nor elated by her summons, but calmly to look
      upon it as a thing of course, from her celebrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should very much have liked to have heard her read the play, but my
      dearest Mrs. Delany spent the whole evening with me, and I could therefore
      take no measures for finding out a convenient adjoining room. Mrs.
      Schwellenberg, I heard afterwards, was so accommodated, though not well
      enough for the tea-table.

      MR. FAIRLY&rsquo;S BEREAVEMENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aug. 23.&mdash;At St. James&rsquo;s I read in the newspapers a paragraph
      that touched me much for the very amiable Mr. Fairly: it was the death of
      his wife, which happened on the Duke of York&rsquo;s birth-day, the 16th.<a
      href="#linknote-242" name="linknoteref-242" id="linknoteref-242"><small>242</small></a>
      Mr. Fairly has devoted his whole time, strength, thoughts, and cares
      solely to nursing and attending her during a long and most painful illness
      which she sustained. They speak of her here as being amiable, but so<span
      class="pagenum">54</span><a name="link54" id="link54"></a> cold and
      reserved, that she was little known, and by no means in equal favour with
      her husband, who stands, upon the whole the highest in general esteem and
      regard of any individual of the household. I find every mouth open to
      praise and pity, love and honour him.

    <h2>
      TROUBLESOME MR. TURBULENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Upon returning to Kew, I had a scene for which I was little enough,
      indeed, prepared, though willing, and indeed, earnest to satisfy Mr.
      Turbulent, I wished him to make an alteration of behaviour. After hastily
      changing my dress, I went, as usual, to the parlour, to be ready for
      dinner; but found there no Mrs. Schwellenberg; she was again unwell; Miss
      Planta was not ready, and Mr. Turbulent was reading by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away he flung his book in a moment, and hastening to shut the door lest I
      should retreat, he rather charged than desired me to explain my late
      &ldquo;chilling demeanour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost startled by his apparent entire ignorance of deserving it, I found
      an awkwardness I had not foreseen in making myself understood. I wished
      him rather to feel than be told the improprieties I meant to obviate and I
      did what was possible by half evasive, half expressive answers, to call
      back his own recollection and consciousness. In vain, however, was the
      attempt; he protested himself wholly innocent, and that he would rather
      make an end of his existence than give me offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw not these very protestations were again doing it, and he grew so
      vehement in his defence, and so reproachful in his accusation of unjust
      usage, that I was soon totally in a perplexity how to extricate myself
      from a difficulty I had regarded simply as his own. The moment he saw I
      grew embarrassed, he redoubled his challenges to know the cause of my
      &ldquo;ill-treatment.&rdquo; I assured him, then, I could never reckon
      silence ill-treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;yes, from you it is ill-treatment, and
      it has given me the most serious uneasiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for that, and did not mean it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not mean it?&rdquo; cried be. &ldquo;Could you imagine I should
      miss your conversation, your ease, your pleasantness, your gaiety, and
      take no notice of the loss?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a most violent flow of compliments, ending with a fresh
      demand for an explanation, made with an energy<span class="pagenum">55</span><a
      name="link55" id="link55"></a> that, to own the truth, once more quite
      frightened me. I endeavoured to appease him, by general promises of
      becoming more voluble and I quite languished to say to him the truth at
      once; that his sport, his spirit, and his society would all be acceptable
      to me, would he but divest them of that redundance of gallantry which
      rendered them offensive: but I could only think how to say this&mdash;I
      could not bring it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      This promised volubility, though it softened him, he seemed to receive as
      a sort of acknowledgment that I owed him some reparation for the
      disturbance I had caused him. I stared enough at such an interpretation,
      which I could by no means allow; but no sooner did I disclaim it than all
      his violence was resumed, and he urged me to give in my charge against him
      with an impetuosity that almost made me tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made as little answer as possible, finding everything I said seemed but
      the more to inflame his violent spirit; but his emotion was such, and the
      cause so inadequate, and my uncertainty so unpleasant what to think of him
      altogether, that I was seized with sensations so nervous, I Could almost
      have cried. In the full torrent of his offended justification against my
      displeasure towards him, he perceived my increasing distress how to
      proceed, and, suddenly stopping, exclaimed in quite another tone, &ldquo;Now,
      then, ma&rsquo;am, I see your justice returning; you feel that you have
      used me very ill!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To my great relief entered Miss Planta. He contrived to say, &ldquo;Remember,
      you promise to explain all this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I made him no sort of answer, and though he frequently, in the course of
      the evening, repeated, &ldquo;I depend upon your promise! I build upon a
      conference,&rdquo; I sent his dependence and his building to Coventry, by
      not seeming to hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I determined, however, to avoid all tête-à-têtes with him whatsoever, as
      much as was in my power. How very few people are fit for them, nobody
      living in trios and quartettos can imagine!

    <h2>
      A CONCEITED PARSON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Windsor.-Who should find me out now but Dr. Shepherd.<a
      href="#linknote-243" name="linknoteref-243" id="linknoteref-243"><small>243</small></a>
      He is here as canon, and was in residence. He told me he had long wished
      to come, but had never been able to find the<span class="pagenum">56</span><a
      name="link56" id="link56"></a> way of entrance before. He made me an
      immense length of visit, and related to me all the exploits of his
      life,-so far as they were prosperous. In no farce did a man ever more
      floridly open upon his own perfections. He assured me I should be
      delighted to know the whole of his life; it was equal to anything; and
      everything he had was got by his own address and ingenuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could tell the king,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;more than all the
      chapter. I want to talk to him, but he always gets out of my way; he does
      not know me; he takes me for a mere common person, like the rest of the
      canons here, and thinks of me no more than if I were only fit for the
      cassock;&mdash;a mere Scotch priest! Bless &lsquo;em!&mdash;they know
      nothing about me. You have no conception what things I have done! And I
      want to tell &lsquo;em all this;&mdash;It&rsquo;s fitter for them to hear
      than what comes to their ears. What I want is for somebody to tell them
      what I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They know it already, thought I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when he had exhausted this general panegyric, he descended to some
      few particulars; especially dilating upon his preaching, and applying to
      me for attesting its excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall make one sermon every year, precisely for you!&rdquo; he
      cried; &ldquo;I think I know what will please you. That on the creation
      last Sunday was just to your taste. You shall have such another next
      residence. I think I preach in the right tone&mdash;not too slow, like
      that poor wretch Grape, nor too fast like Davis and the rest of &lsquo;em;
      but yet fast enough never to tire them. That&rsquo;s just my idea of good
      preaching.&rdquo;

      Then he told me what excellent apartments he had here and how much he
      should like my opinion in fitting them up.

    <h2>
      MR. TURBULENT BECOMES A NUISANCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aug.30.&mdash;Mrs. Schwellenberg invited Mr. Turbulent to dinner, for she
      said he had a large correspondence, and might amuse her. He came early;
      and finding nobody in the eating-parlour, begged to wait in mine till Mrs.
      Schwellenberg came downstairs. This was the last thing I wished; but he
      required no answer, and instantly resumed the Kew discussion, entreating
      me to tell him what he had done. I desired him to desist&mdash;in vain, he
      affirmed I had promised him an explanation, and he had therefore a right
      to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fully mistook me, then,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;for I meant no
      <span class="pagenum">57</span><a name="link57" id="link57"></a> such
      thing then; I mean no such thing now; and I never shall mean any such
      thing in future. Is this explicit? I think it best to tell you so at once,
      that you may expect nothing more, but give over the subject, and talk of
      something else. What is the news?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk of nothing else!&mdash;it distracts me;&mdash;pray
      No, no, tell Me!&mdash;I call upon your good-nature!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none&mdash;about this!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon your goodness of heart!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis all hardness here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will cast myself at your feet,&mdash;I will kneel to you!&rdquo;
      And he was preparing his immense person for prostration, when Goter<a
      href="#linknote-244" name="linknoteref-244" id="linknoteref-244"><small>244</small></a>
      opened the door. Such an interruption to his heroics made me laugh
      heartily; nor could he help joining himself; though the moment she was
      gone he renewed his importunity with unabated earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it was upon the Terrace you
      first shewed me this disdain; and there, too, you have shown it me
      repeatedly since, with public superciliousness.... You well know you have
      treated me ill,&mdash;you know and have acknowledged it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when?&rdquo; cried I, amazed and provoked; &ldquo;when did I do
      what could never be done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Kew, ma&rsquo;am, you were full of concern&mdash;full of remorse
      for the treatment you had given me!&mdash;and you owned it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heaven, Mr. Turbulent, what can induce you to say this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not true?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word of it! You know it is not!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I really and truly thought so&mdash;hoped
      so;&mdash;I believed you looked as if you felt your own ill-usage, and it
      gave to me a delight inexpressible!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was almost enough to bring back the very same supercilious Distance
      of which he complained; but, in dread of fresh explanations, I forbore to
      notice this flight, and only told him he might be perfectly satisfied,
      since I no longer Persevered in the taciturnity to which he objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;do you give up, without deigning
      to assign one reason for It&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The greater the compliment!&rdquo; cried I, laughing; &ldquo;I give
      up to your request.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, upon my speaking,-but why did you keep Me so long
      in that painful suspense?"<span class="pagenum">58</span><a name="link58"
      id="link58"></a> &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;could I well be
      quicker? Till you spoke could I know if you heeded it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;is there no language but of words? Do you
      pretend to think there is no other?&mdash;Must I teach it you?&mdash;teach
      it to Miss Burney who speaks, who understands it so well?&mdash;who is
      never silent, and never can be silent?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came his heroic old homage to the poor eyebrows vehemently
      finishing with, &ldquo;Do you, can you affect to know no language but
      speech?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not,&rdquo; cried I, coolly, &ldquo;without the trouble of more
      investigation than I had taken here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He called this &ldquo;contempt,&rdquo; and, exceedingly irritated, de
      sired me, once more, to explain, from beginning to end, how he had ever
      offended me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Turbulent,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;will you be satisfied if I
      tell you it shall all blow over?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make me a vow, then, you will never more, never while you live,
      resume that proud taciturnity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&mdash;certainly not; I never make vows; it is a rule with
      me to avoid them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me, then, your promise,&mdash;your solemn promise,&mdash;at
      least I may claim that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the same peculiarity about promises; I never make them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was again beginning to storm, but again I assured him I would let the
      acquaintance take its old course, if he would but be appeased, and say no
      more; and, after difficulties innumerable, he at length gave up the point:
      but to this he was hastened, if not driven, by a summons to dinner.

    <h2>
      DR. HERSCHEL AND HIS SISTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sept.-Dr. Herschel is a delightful man; so unassuming with his great
      knowledge, so willing to dispense it to the ignorant, and so cheerful and
      easy in his general manners, that were he no genius it would be impossible
      not to remark him as a pleasing and sensible man. I was equally pleased
      with his sister, whom I had wished to see very much, for her great
      celebrity in her brother&rsquo;s science. She is very little, very gentle,
      very modest, and very ingenious; and her manners are those of a person
      unhackneyed and unawed by the world, yet desirous to meet<span
      class="pagenum">59</span><a name="link59" id="link59"></a> and to return
      its smiles. I love not the philosophy that braves it. This brother and
      sister seem gratified with its favour, at the same time that their own
      pursuit is all-sufficient to them without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I inquired of Miss Herschel if she was still comet-hunting, or content now
      with the moon? The brother answered that he had the charge of the moon,
      but he left to his sister to sweep the heavens for comets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their manner of working together is most ingenious and curious. While he
      makes his observations without-doors, he has a method of communicating
      them to his sister so immediately, that she can instantly commit them to
      paper, with the precise moment in which they are made. By this means he
      loses not a minute, when there is anything particularly worth observing,
      by writing it down, but can still proceed, yet still have his accounts and
      calculations exact. The methods he has contrived to facilitate this
      commerce I have not the terms to explain, though his simple manner of
      showing them made me, fully, at the time, comprehend them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night, unfortunately, was dark, and I could not see the moon with the
      famous new telescope. I mean not the great telescope through which I had
      taken a walk, for that is still incomplete, but another of uncommon
      powers. I saw Saturn, however, and his satellites, very distinctly, and
      their appearance was very beautiful.

    <h2>
      GAY AND ENTERTAINING MR. BUNBURY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sept.-I saw a great deal of Mr. Bunbury in the course of this month, as he
      was in waiting upon the Duke of York, who spent great part of it at
      Windsor, to the inexpressible delight of his almost idolising father. Mr.
      Bunbury did not open upon me with that mildness and urbanity that might
      lead me to forget the strokes of his pencil, and power of his caricature:
      he early avowed a general disposition to laugh at, censure, or despise all
      around him. He began talking of everybody and everything about us, with
      the decisive freedom of a confirmed old intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in disgrace here, already!&rdquo; he cried almost exultingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In disgrace?&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;for not riding out this morning!&mdash;I was asked&mdash;what
      Could I have better to do?&mdash;Ha! ha!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next time that I saw him after your departure from<span class="pagenum">60</span><a
      name="link60" id="link60"></a> Windsor,<a href="#linknote-245"
      name="linknoteref-245" id="linknoteref-245"><small>245</small></a> he
      talked a great deal of painting and painters, and then said, &ldquo;The
      draftsman of whom I think the most highly of any in the world was in this
      room the other day, and I did not know it, and was not introduced to him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I immediately assured him I never held the honours of the room when its
      right mistress was in it, but that I would certainly have named them to
      each other had I known he desired it. &ldquo;O, yes,&rdquo;&rsquo; cried
      he, &ldquo;of all things I wished to know him. He draws like the old
      masters. I have seen fragments in the style of many of the very best and
      first productions of the greatest artists of former times. He could
      deceive the most critical judge. I wish greatly for a sight of his works,
      and for the possession of one of them, to add to my collection, as I have
      something from almost everybody else and a small sketch of his I should
      esteem a greater curiosity than all the rest put together."<a
      href="#linknote-246" name="linknoteref-246" id="linknoteref-246"><small>246</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Moved by the justness of&rsquo; this praise, I fetched him the sweet
      little cadeaux so lately left me by Mr. William&rsquo;s kindness. He was
      very much pleased, and perhaps thought I might bestow them. O, no&mdash;not
      one stroke of that pencil could I relinquish!
    </p>
    <p>
      Another evening he gave us the history, of his way of life at
      Brighthelmstone. He spoke highly of the duke, but with much satire of all
      else, and that incautiously, and evidently with an innate defiance of
      consequences, from a consciousness of secret powers to overawe their
      hurting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the general reverence I pay to extraordinary talents,
      which lead me to think it even a species of impertinence to dwell upon
      small failings in their rare possessors, Mr. Bunbury did not gain my
      good-will. His serious manner is supercilious and haughty, and his easy
      conversation wants rectitude in its principles. For the rest, he is
      entertaining and gay, full of talk, sociable, willing to enjoy what is
      going forward, and ready to speak his opinion with perfect unreserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plays and players seem his darling theme; he can rave about them from
      morning to night, and yet be ready to rave again when morning returns, He
      acts as he talks, spouts as<span class="pagenum">61</span><a name="link61"
      id="link61"></a> he recollects, and seems to give his whole soul to
      dramatic feeling and expression. This is not, however, his only subject
      Love and romance are equally clear to his discourse, though they cannot be
      introduced with equal frequency. Upon these topics he loses himself wholly&mdash;he
      runs into rhapsodies that discredit him at once as a father, a husband,
      and a moral man. He asserts that love Is the first principle of life, and
      should take place of every other; holds all bonds and obligations as
      nugatory that would claim a preference; and advances such doctrines of
      exalted sensations in the tender passion as made me tremble while I heard
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He adores Werter, and would scarce believe I had not read it&mdash;still
      less that I had begun It and left it off, from distaste at its evident
      tendency. I saw myself sink instantly in his estimation, though till this
      little avowal I had appeared to Stand in it very honourably.

    <h2>
      THE PRINCE OF WALES AT WINDSOR AGAIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One evening, while I was sitting with Mrs. Delany, and her fair niece,
      when tea was over, and the gentlemen all withdrawn, the door was Opened,
      and a star entered, that I perceived presently to be the Prince of Wales.
      He was here to hunt with his royal father and brother. With great
      politeness he made me his first bow, and then advancing to Mrs. Delany,
      insisted, very considerately, on her sitting still, though he stood
      himself for half an hour&mdash;all the time he stayed. He entered into
      discourse very good-humouredly, and with much vivacity; described to her
      his villa at Brighthelmstone, told several anecdotes of adventures there,
      and seemed desirous to entertain both her and myself.....
    </p>
    <p>
      NOV. 8.&mdash;At near one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, while the wardrobe
      woman was pinning up the queen&rsquo;s hair, there was a sudden rap-tap at
      the dressing-room door. Extremely surprised, I looked at the queen, to see
      what should be done; she did not speak. I had never heard such a sound
      before, for at the royal doors there Is always a peculiar kind of scratch
      used, instead of tapping. I heard it, however, again,&mdash;and the queen
      called out, &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; I Was really startled, not
      conceiving who could take so strange a liberty as to come to the queen&rsquo;s
      apartment without the announcing of a page and no page, I was very sure,
      would make such a noise. <span class="pagenum">62</span><a name="link62"
      id="link62"></a> Again the sound was repeated, and more smartly. I grew
      quite alarmed, imagining some serious evil at hand&mdash;either regarding
      the king or some of the princesses. The queen, however, bid me open the
      door. I did&mdash;but what was MY surprise to see there a large man, in an
      immense wrapping great coat, buttoned up round his chin, so that he was
      almost hid between cape and hat!
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood quite motionless for a moment&mdash;but he, as if also surprised,
      drew back; I felt quite sick with sudden terror&mdash;I really thought
      some ruffian had broke into the house, or a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; cried the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she called aloud; and then, taking off his hat,
      entered the Prince of Wales!
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen laughed very much, so did I too, happy in this unexpected
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her, eagerly, he merely came to inform her there were the most
      beautiful northern lights to be seen that could possibly be imagined, and
      begged her to come to the gallery windows.

    <h2>
      FALSE RUMOURS OF MISS BURNEY&rsquo;S RESIGNATION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wednesday, Sept. 14&mdash;We went to town for the drawing-room, and I
      caught a most severe cold, by being oblige to have the glass down on my
      side, to suit Mrs. Schwellenberg, though the sharpest wind blew in that
      ever attacked a poor phiz. However, these are the sort of desagremens I
      can always best bear; and for the rest, I have now pretty constant
      civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear father drank tea with me but told me of a paragraph in &ldquo;The
      World,&rdquo; that gave me some uneasiness; to this effect:&mdash;&ldquo;We
      hear that Miss Burney has resigned her place about the queen, and is now
      promoted to attend the princesses, an office far more suited to her
      character and abilities, which will now be called forth as they merit.&rdquo;&mdash;Or
      to that purpose. As &ldquo;The World&rdquo; is not taken in here, I
      flattered myself it would not be known; for I knew how little pleasure
      such a paragraph would give, and was very sorry for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, at St. James&rsquo;s, Miss Planta desired to speak to me,
      before the queen arrived. She acquainted me Of the same &ldquo;news,&rdquo;
      and said, &ldquo;Everybody spoke of it;&rdquo; and the queen might receive
      twenty letters of recommend, to<span class="pagenum">63</span><a
      name="link63" id="link63"></a> my place before night. Still I could only
      be sorry. Another paragraph had now appeared, she told me, contradicting
      the first, and saying, &ldquo;The resignation of Miss Burney is premature;
      it only arose from an idea of the service the education of the princesses
      might reap from her virtues and accomplishments.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was really concerned conscious how little gratified my royal mistress
      would be by the whole&mdash;and, presently, Miss Planta came to me again,
      and told me that the princesses had mentioned it! They never read any
      newspapers; but they had heard of it from the Duke of York. I observed the
      queen was most particularly gracious with me, softer, gentler, more
      complacent than ever; and, while dressing, she dismissed her
      wardrobe-woman, and, looking at me very steadfastly, said, &ldquo;Miss
      Burney, do you ever read newspapers?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but not often: however. I
      believe I know what your majesty means!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I could say no less; I was so sure of her meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, and I have been very much hurt by it: that is, if
      your majesty means anything relative to myself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do!&rdquo; she answered, still looking at me with earnestness.
      &ldquo;My father, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;told me of it last
      night, with a good deal of indignation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;did not see it myself: you know how
      little I read the newspapers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;as it was in a paper not taken in
      here, I hoped it would quite have escaped your majesty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;.So it did: I only heard of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked a little curious, and she kindly explained herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the Duke of York came yesterday to dinner, he said almost
      immediately, &lsquo;Pray, ma&rsquo;am, what has Miss Burney left You for?&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Left me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, they say she&rsquo;s gone; pray what&rsquo;s
      the reason?&rsquo; &lsquo;Gone?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s at full
      length in all the newspapers: is not she gone?&rsquo; &lsquo;Not that I
      know of.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the newspapers&rdquo; was undoubtedly a little flourish of the
      duke; but we jointly censured and lamented the unbridled liberty of the
      press, in thus inventing, contradicting, and bringing on and putting off,
      whatever they pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw, however, she had really been staggered: she concluded, I fancy,
      that the paragraph arose from some latent Muse, which might end in matter
      of fact; for she talked to me of Mrs. Dickenson, and of all that related
      to her retreat, and<span class="pagenum">64</span><a name="link64"
      id="link64"></a> dwelt upon the subject with a sort of solicitude that
      seemed apprehensive&mdash;if I may here use such a word-of a similar
      action. It appeared to me that she rather expected some further assurance
      on my part that no such view or intention had given rise to this pretended
      report; and therefore, when I had again the honour of her conversation
      alone, I renewed the subject, and mentioned that my father had had some
      thoughts of contradicting the paragraph himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has he done it?&rdquo; cried she quite eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am; for, upon further consideration, he feared it
      might only excite fresh paragraphs, and that the whole would sooner die,
      if neglected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have been told; for, some years ago,
      there was a paragraph in the papers I wanted myself to have had
      contradicted, but they acquainted me it was best to be patient, and it
      would be forgot the sooner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, however, ma&rsquo;am, has been contradicted this morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By your father?&rdquo; cried she, again speaking eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am; I know not by whom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She then asked how it was done. This was very distressing but I was forced
      to repeat It as well as I could, reddening enough, though omitting, you
      may believe, the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then there happened an interruption; which was vexatious, as it
      prevented a concluding speech, disclaiming all thoughts of resignation,
      which I saw was really now become necessary for the queen&rsquo;s
      satisfaction; and since it was true&mdash;why not say it? And,
      accordingly, the next day, when she was most excessively kind to me, I
      seized an opportunity, by attending her through the apartments to the
      breakfast-room, to beg, permission to speak to her. It was smilingly
      granted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have now, ma&rsquo;am, read both the paragraphs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; with a look of much curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And indeed I thought them both very impertinent. They say that the
      idea arose from a notion of my being promoted to a place about the
      princesses!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not seen either of the paragraphs,&rdquo; she answered,
      &ldquo;but the Prince of Wales told me of the second yesterday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They little know me, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;who think
      I should regard any other place as a promotion that removed me from your
      majesty.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">65</span><a name="link65" id="link65"></a>
      &ldquo;I did not take it ill, I assure you,&rdquo; cried she, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, ma&rsquo;am, I am far from having a wish for any such
      promotion&mdash;far from it! your majesty does not bestow a smile upon me
      that does not secure and confirm my attachment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One of her best smiles followed this, with a very condescending little
      bow, and the words, &ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; uttered in a most
      gentle Voice; and she went on to her breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am most glad this complete explanation passed. Indeed it is most true I
      would not willingly quit a place about the queen for any place; and I was
      glad to mark that her smiles were to me the whole estimate of its value.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little matter has proved, in the end, very gratifying to me for it
      has made clear beyond all doubt her desire of retaining me, and a
      considerably increased degree of attention and complacency have most
      flatteringly shown a wish I should be retained by attachment.

    <h2>
      TYRANNICAL MRS. SCHWELLENBERG.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nov. 27-I had a terrible journey indeed to town, Mrs. Schwellenberg
      finding it expedient to have the glass down on my side, whence there blew
      in a sharp wind, which so painfully attacked my eyes that they were
      inflamed even before we-arrived in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. de Luc and Miss Planta both looked uneasy, but no one durst speak; and
      for me, it was among the evils that I can always best bear yet before the
      evening I grew so ill that I could not propose going to Chelsea, lest I
      should be utterly unfitted for Thursday&rsquo;s drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, however, I received a consolation that has been some ease to
      my mind ever since. My dear father spent the evening with me, and was so
      incensed at the state of my eyes, which were now as piteous to behold as
      to feel, and at the relation of their usage, that he charged me, another
      time, to draw up my &lsquo;glass in defiance of all opposition, and to
      abide by all consequences, since my place was wholly immaterial when put
      in competition with my health.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was truly glad of this permission to rebel, and it has given Me an
      internal hardiness in all similar assaults, that has at least relieved my
      mind from the terror of giving mortal offence where most I owe implicit
      obedience, should provocation overpower my capacity of forbearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we assembled to return to Windsor, Mr. de Luc was<span class="pagenum">66</span><a
      name="link66" id="link66"></a> in real consternation at sight of my eyes;
      and I saw an indignant glance at my coadjutrix, that could scarce content
      itself without being understood. Miss Planta ventured not at such a
      glance, but a whisper broke out, as we were descending the stairs,
      expressive of horror against the same poor person&mdash;poor person indeed&mdash;to
      exercise a power productive only of abhorrence, to those who view as well
      as to those who feel it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Some business of Mrs. Schwellenberg&rsquo;s occasioned a delay of the
      journey, and we all retreated back; and when I returned to my room,
      Miller, the old head housemaid, came to me, with a little neat tin
      saucepan in her hand, saying, &ldquo;Pray, ma&rsquo;am, use this for your
      eyes; &rsquo;tis milk and butter, much as I used to make for Madame
      Haggerdorn when she travelled in the winter with Mrs. Schwellenberg.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Good heaven! I really shuddered when she added, that all that poor woman&rsquo;s
      misfortunes with her eyes, which, from inflammation after inflammation,
      grew nearly blind, were attributed by herself to these journeys, in which
      she was forced to have the glass down at her side in all weathers, and
      frequently the glasses behind her also! Upon my word this account of my
      predecessor was the least exhilarating intelligence I could receive! Goter
      told me, afterwards, that all the servants in the house had remarked I was
      going just the same way!
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta presently ran into my room, to say she had hopes we should
      travel without this amiable being; and she had left me but a moment when
      Mrs. Stainforth succeeded her, exclaiming, &ldquo;O, for heaven&rsquo;s
      sake, don&rsquo;t leave her behind; for heaven&rsquo;s sake, Miss Burney,
      take her with you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Twas impossible not to laugh at these opposite&rsquo; interests, both,
      from agony of fear, breaking through all restraint. Soon after, however,
      we all assembled again, and got into the coach. Mr.&rsquo; de Luc, who was
      my vis-a-vis, instantly pulled up the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put down that glass!&rdquo; was the immediate order.
    </p>
    <p>
      He affected not to hear her, and began conversing. She enraged quite
      tremendously, calling aloud to be obeyed without delay. He looked
      compassionately at me, and shrugged his shoulders, and said, &ldquo;But,
      ma&rsquo;am-&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it, Mr. de Luc, when I tell you! I will have it! When you been
      too cold, you might bear it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not for me, ma&rsquo;am, but poor Miss Burney.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, poor Miss Burney might bear it the same! put it down, Mr. de
      Luc! without, I will get out! put it down, when I tell<span class="pagenum">67</span><a
      name="link67" id="link67"></a> you! It is my coach! I will have it selfs!
      I might go alone in it, or with one, or with what you call nobody, when I
      please!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Frightened for good Mr. de Luc, and the more for being much obliged to
      him, I now interfered, and begged him to let down the glass. Very
      reluctantly he complied, and I leant back in the coach, and held up my
      muff to my eyes. What a journey ensued! To see that face when lighted up
      with fury is a sight for horror! I was glad to exclude it by my muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta alone attempted to speak. I did not think it incumbent on me
      to &ldquo;make the agreeable,&rdquo; thus used; I was therefore wholly
      dumb: for not a word, not an apology, not one expression of being sorry
      for what I suffered, was uttered. The most horrible ill-humour, violence,
      and rudeness, were all that were shown. Mr. de Luc was too much provoked
      to take his usual method of passing all off by constant talk and as I had
      never seen him venture to appear provoked before, I felt a great
      obligation to his kindness. When we were about half way, we stopped to
      water the horses. He then again pulled up the glass, as if from absence. A
      voice of fury exclaimed, &ldquo;Let it down! without I won&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;all Mrs. de Luc&rsquo;s plants
      will be killed by this frost For the frost was very severe indeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he proposed my changing places with Miss Planta, who sat opposite
      Mrs. Schwellenberg, and consequently on the sheltered side. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
      cried Mrs. Schwellenberg, &ldquo;MISS Burney might sit there, and so she
      ought!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her, briefly, I was always sick in riding backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, ver well! when you don&rsquo;t like it, don&rsquo;t do it. You
      might bear it when you like it? what did the poor Haggerdorn bear it! when
      the blood was all running down from her eyes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was too much! &ldquo;I must take, then,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;the
      more warning!&rdquo; After that I spoke not a word. I ruminated all the
      rest of the way upon my dear father&rsquo;s recent charge and permission.
      I was upon the point continually of availing myself of both, but alas! I
      felt the deep disappointment I should give him, and I felt the most cruel
      repugnance to owe a resignation to a quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      These reflections powerfully forbade the rebellion to which this
      unequalled arrogance and cruelty excited me; and after revolving them
      again and again, I accepted a bit of cake which she suddenly offered me as
      we reached Windsor, and<span class="pagenum">68</span><a name="link68"
      id="link68"></a> determined, since I submitted to my monastic destiny from
      motives my serious thoughts deemed right, I would not be prompted to
      oppose it from mere feelings of resentment to one who, strictly, merited
      only contempt....
    </p>
    <p>
      I gulped as well as I could at dinner; but all civil fits are again over.
      Not a word was said to me: yet I was really very ill all the afternoon;
      the cold had seized my elbows, from holding them up so long, and I was
      stiff and chilled all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, however, came my soothing Mrs. Delany. Sweet soul! she
      folded me in her arms, and wept over my shoulder! Too angry to stand upon
      ceremony she told Mrs. Schwellenberg, after our public tea, she must
      retire to my room, that she might speak with me alone. This was highly
      resented, and I was threatened, afterwards, that she would come to tea no
      more, and we might talk our secrets always.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. de Luc called upon me next morning, and openly avowed his indignation,
      protesting it was an oppression he could not bear to see used, and
      reproving me for checking him when he would have run all risks. I thanked
      him most cordially; but assured him the worst of all inflammations to me
      was that of a quarrel, and I entreated him, therefore, not to interfere.
      But we have been cordial friends from that time forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta also called, kindly bringing me some eye-water, and telling me
      she had &ldquo;Never so longed to beat anybody in her life; and yet, I
      assure you,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;everybody remarks that she behaves,
      altogether, better to you than to any body!&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      MRS. SCHWELLENBERG&rsquo;S CAPRICIOUSNESS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Saturday, Dec. 1.&mdash;&lsquo;Tis strange that two feelings so very
      opposite as love and resentment should have nearly equal power in
      inspiring courage for or against the object that excites them yet so it
      is. In former times I have often, on various occasions, felt it raised to
      anything possible, by affection, and now I have found it mount to the
      boldest height, by disdain For, be it known, such gross and harsh usage I
      experienced at the end of last month, since the inflammation of the eyes
      which I bore much more composedly than sundry personal indignities that
      followed, that I resolved upon a new mode of<span class="pagenum">69</span><a
      name="link69" id="link69"></a> conduct&mdash;namely, to go out every
      evening, in Order to show that I by no means considered myself as bound to
      stay at home after dinner, if treated very ill; and this most courageous
      plan I flattered myself must needs either procure me a liberty of absence,
      always so much wished, or occasion a change of behaviour to more decency
      and endurability. I had received for to-day an invitation to meet Lady
      Bute and Lady Louisa Stuart at my dearest Mrs. Delany&rsquo;s, and I
      should have wished it at all times, so much I like them both. I had no
      opportunity to speak first to my royal mistress, but I went to her at
      noon, rather more dressed than usual, and when I saw her look a little
      surprised, I explained my reason. She seemed very well satisfied with it,
      but my coadjutrix appeared in an astonishment unequalled, and at dinner,
      when we necessarily met again, new testimonies of conduct quite without
      example were exhibited: for when Mrs. Thackeray and Miss Planta were
      helped, she helped herself, and appeared publicly to send me to Coventry&mdash;though
      the sole provocation was intending to forego her society this evening!
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat quiet and unhelped a few minutes, considering what to do: for so
      little was my appetite, I was almost tempted to go without dinner
      entirely. However, upon further reflection, I concluded it would but
      harden her heart still more to have this fresh affront so borne, and so
      related, as it must have been, through Windsor, and therefore I calmly
      begged some greens from Miss Planta.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weakness of my eyes, which still would not bear the light, prevented
      me from tasting animal food all this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little ashamed, she then anticipated Miss Planta&rsquo;s assistance, by
      offering me some French beans. To curb my own displeasure, I obliged
      myself to accept them. Unfortunately, however, this little softening was
      presently worn out, by some speeches which it encouraged from Mrs.
      Thackeray, who seemed to seize the moment of permission to acknowledge
      that I was in the room, by telling me she had lately met some of my
      friends in town, among whom Mrs. Chapone and the Burrows family had
      charged her with a thousand regrets for My Seclusion from their society,
      and as many kind compliments and good wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This again sent me to Coventry for the rest of the dinner. When it was
      over, and we were all going upstairs to coffee, I spoke to Columb,<a
      href="#linknote-247" name="linknoteref-247" id="linknoteref-247"><small>247</small></a>
      in passing, to have a chair for me at seven o&rsquo;clock.<span
      class="pagenum">70</span><a name="link70" id="link70"></a> &ldquo;For
      what, then,&rdquo; cried a stern voice behind me, &ldquo;for what go you
      upstairs at all, when you don&rsquo;t drink coffee?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Did she imagine I should answer &ldquo;For your society, ma&rsquo;am&rdquo;?
      No&mdash;I turned back quick as lightning, and only saying, &ldquo;Very
      well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; moved towards my own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again a little ashamed of herself, she added, rather more civilly, &ldquo;For
      what should you have that trouble?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I simply repeated my &ldquo;Very well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; in a voice of,
      I believe, rather pique than calm acquiescence, and entered my own
      apartment, unable to enjoy this little release, however speedy to obtain
      it, from the various, the grievous emotions of my mind, that this was the
      person, use me how she might, with whom I must chiefly pass my time!
    </p>
    <p>
      So unpleasant were the sensations that filled me, that I could recover no
      gaiety, even at the house of my beloved friend, though received there by
      her dear self, her beautiful niece, and Lady Bute and Lady Louisa, in the
      most flattering manner....
    </p>
    <p>
      The behaviour of my coadjutrix continued in the same strain&mdash;really
      shocking to endure. I always began, at our first meeting, some little
      small speech, and constantly received so harsh a rebuff at the second
      word, that I then regularly seated myself by a table, at work, and
      remained wholly silent the rest of the day. I tried the experiment of
      making my escape; but I was fairly conquered from pursuing it. The
      constant black reception depressed me out of powers to exert for flight;
      and therefore I relinquished this plan, and only got off, as I could, to
      my own room, or remained dumb in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To detail the circumstances of the tyranny and the grossierete I
      experienced at this time would be afflicting to my beloved friends, and
      oppressive to myself, I am fain, however, to confess they vanquished me. I
      found the restoration of some degree of decency quite necessary to my
      quiet, since such open and horrible ill-will from one daily in my sight
      even affrighted me: it pursued me in shocking visions even when I avoided
      her presence; and therefore I was content to put upon myself the great and
      cruel force of seeking to conciliate a person who had no complaint against
      me, but that she had given me an inflammation of the eyes, which had been
      witnessed and resented by her favourite Mr. de Luc. I rather believe that
      latter circumstance was what incensed her so inveterately.<span
      class="pagenum">71</span><a name="link71" id="link71"></a> The next
      extraordinary step she took was one that promised me amends for all: she
      told me that there was no occasion we should continue together after
      coffee, unless by her invitation. I eagerly exclaimed that this seemed a
      most feasible way of producing some variety in our intercourse, and that I
      would adopt it most readily. She wanted instantly to call back her words:
      she had expected I should be alarmed, and solicit her leave to be
      buried-with her every evening! When she saw me so eager in acceptance, she
      looked mortified and disappointed; but I would not suffer her to retract,
      and I began, at once, to retire to my room the moment coffee was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      This flight of the sublime, which, being her own, she could not resent,
      brought all round: for as she saw me every evening prepare to depart with
      the coffee, she constantly began, at that period, some civil discourse to
      detain me. I always suffered it to succeed, while civil, and when there
      was a failure, or a pause, I retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this means I recovered such portion of quiet as is compatible with a
      situation like mine: for she soon returned entirely to such behaviour as
      preceded the offence of my eyes; and I obtained a little leisure at which
      she could not repine, as a caprice of her own bestowed it....
    </p>
    <p>
      To finish, however, with respect to the présidente, I must now acquaint
      you that, as my eyes entirely grew-well, her incivility entirely wore off,
      and I became a far greater favourite than I had ever presumed to think
      myself till that time! I was obliged to give up my short-lived privilege
      of retirement, and live on as before, making only my two precious little
      visits to my beloved comforter and supporter, and to devote the rest of my
      wearisome time to her presence&mdash;better satisfied, however, since I
      now saw that open war made me wretched, even When a victor, beyond what
      any subjection could do that had peace for its terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not an unuseful discovery, for it has abated all propensity to
      experiment in shaking off a yoke which, however hard to bear, is so
      annexed to my place, that I must take one with the other, and endure them
      as I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      My favour, now, was beyond the favour of all others; I was &ldquo;good
      Miss Berner,&rdquo; at every other word, and no one else was listened to
      if I would speak, and no one else was Accepted for a partner if I would
      play! I found no cause to Which I could attribute this change. I believe
      the whole mere Matter of caprice.<span class="pagenum">72</span><a
      name="link72" id="link72"></a> New YEAR&rsquo;s DAY.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen&rsquo;s Lodge, Windsor, Tuesday, Jan. 1, 1788-I began the new year,
      as I ended the old one, by seizing the first moment it presented to my own
      disposal, for flying to Mrs. Delany, and begging her annual benediction.
      She bestowed it with the sweetest affection, and I spent, as usual all the
      time with her I had to spare....
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, by long appointment, I was to receive Mr. Fisher and his
      bride.<a href="#linknote-248" name="linknoteref-248" id="linknoteref-248"><small>248</small></a>
      Mrs. Schwellenberg, of her own accord desired me to have them in my room,
      and said she would herself make tea for the equerries in the
      eating-parlour. Mrs. Delany and Miss Port came to meet them. Mrs. Fisher
      seems good-natured, cheerful, and obliging, neither well nor ill in
      appearance, and, I fancy, not strongly marked in any way. But she adores
      Mr. Fisher, and has brought him a large fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess Amelia was brought by Mrs. Cheveley, to fetch Mrs. Delany to
      the queen. Mrs. Fisher was much delighted in seeing her royal highness,
      who, when in a grave humour, does &lsquo;the honours of her rank with a
      seriousness extremely entertaining. She commands the company to sit down,
      holds out her little fat hand to be kissed, and makes a distant courtesy,
      with an air of complacency and encouragement that might suit any princess
      of five times her age.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had much discourse, while the rest were engaged, with Mr. Fisher, about
      my ever-valued, ever-regretted Mrs. Thrale. Can I call her by another
      name, loving that name so long, so well, for her and her sake? He gave me
      concern by information that she is now publishing, not only the &ldquo;Letters&rdquo;
      of Dr. Johnson, but her own. How strange!
    </p>
    <p>
      Jan. 4.&mdash;In the morning, Mrs. Schwellenberg presented me, from the
      queen, with a new year&rsquo;s gift. It is plate, and very elegant. The
      queen, I find, makes presents to her whole household every year: more or
      less, according to some standard of their claims which she sets up, very
      properly, in her own mind.

    <h2>
      CHATTY MR. BRYANT AGAIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jan. 8.&mdash;I met Mr. Bryant, who came, by appointment to give me that
      pleasure. He was in very high spirits, full Of anecdote and amusement. He
      has as much good-humoured<span class="pagenum">73</span><a name="link73"
      id="link73"></a> chit-chat and entertaining gossiping as if he had given
      no time to the classics and his studies, instead of having nearly devoted
      his life to them. One or two of his little anecdotes I will try to
      recollect.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year thirty-three of this century, and in his own memory, there was
      a cause brought before a judge, between two highwaymen, who had quarrelled
      about the division of their booty; and these men had the effrontery to
      bring their dispute to trial. &ldquo;In the petition of the plaintiff,&rdquo;
      said Mr. Bryant, &ldquo;he asserted that he had been extremely ill-used by
      the defendant: that they had carried on a very advantageous trade
      together, upon Black-heath, Hounslow-heath, Bagshot-heath, and other
      places; that their business chiefly consisted in watches, wearing apparel,
      and trinkets of all sorts, as well as large concerns between them in cash;
      that they had agreed to an equitable partition of all profits, and that
      this agreement had been violated. So impudent a thing, the judge said, was
      never before brought out in a court, and so he refused to pass sentence in
      favour of either of them, and dismissed them from the court.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he told us a great number of comic slip-slops, of the first Lord
      Baltimore, who made a constant misuse of one word for another: for
      instance, &ldquo;I have been,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;upon a little
      excoriation to see a ship lanced; and there is not a finer going vessel
      upon the face of God&rsquo;s earth: you&rsquo;ve no idiom how well it
      sailed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having given us this elegant specimen of the language of one lord, he
      proceeded to give us one equally forcible of the understanding of another.
      The late Lord Plymouth, meeting in a country town with a puppet-show, was
      induced to see it; and, from the high entertainment he received through
      Punch, he determined to buy him, and accordingly asked his price, and paid
      it, and carried the puppet to his country-house, that he might be diverted
      with him at any odd hour. Mr. Bryant protests he met the same troop Just
      as the purchase had been made, and went himself to the puppet-show, which
      was exhibited senza punch!
    </p>
    <p>
      Next he spoke upon the Mysteries, or origin of our theatrical
      entertainments, and repeated the plan and conduct Of several Of these
      strange compositions, in particular one he remembered which was called
      &ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark,&rdquo; and in which that patriarch and his sons,
      just previous to the Deluge, made it all their delight to speed themselves
      into the ark without Mrs. Noah, <span class="pagenum">74</span><a
      name="link74" id="link74"></a> whom they wished to escape; but she
      surprised them just as they had embarked, and made so prodigious a racket
      against the door that, after a long and violent contention, she forced
      them to open it, and gained admission, having first content, them by being
      kept out till she was thoroughly wet to the skin. These most eccentric and
      unaccountable dramas filled up the chief of our conversation.

    <h2>
      DR. JOHNSON&rsquo;s LETTERS To MRS. THRALE DISCUSSED. Wednesday, Jan.
    </h2>
    <p>
      9.&mdash;To-day Mrs. Schwellenberg did me a real favour, and with real
      good nature; for she sent me the &ldquo;Letters&rdquo; of my poor lost
      friends, Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale,<a href="#linknote-249"
      name="linknoteref-249" id="linknoteref-249"><small>249</small></a> which
      she knew me to be almost pining to procure. The book belongs to the Bishop
      of Carlisle, who lent it to Mr. Turbulent, from whom it was again lent to
      the queen, and so passed on to Mrs. Schwellenberg. It is still
      unpublished.
    </p>
    <p>
      With what a sadness have I been reading!&mdash;what scenes in it revived!&mdash;what
      regrets renewed! These letters have not been more improperly published in
      the whole, than they are injudiciously displayed in their several parts.
      She has all&mdash;every word&mdash;and thinks that, perhaps, a justice to
      Dr. Johnson, which, in fact, is the greatest injury to his memory. The few
      she has selected of her own do her, indeed, much credit; she has discarded
      all that were trivial and merely local, and given only such as contain
      something instructive, amusing, or ingenious.
    </p>
    <p>
      About four of the letters, however, of my ever-revered Dr. Johnson are
      truly worthy his exalted powers: one is upon death, in considering its
      approach as we are surrounded, or not by mourners; another, upon the
      sudden and premature loss of poor Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s darling and only
      son.<a href="#linknote-250" name="linknoteref-250" id="linknoteref-250"><small>250</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our name once occurs: how I started at its sight It is to mention the
      party that planned the first visit to our house: Miss Owen, Mr. Seward,
      Mrs. and Miss Thrale, and Dr. Johnson. How well shall we ever, my Susan,
      remember that morning!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have had so many attacks upon her subject, that at last I fairly begged
      quarter,&mdash;and frankly owned to Mrs. Schwellenberg that I could not
      endure to speak any more upon the matter, endeavouring, at the same time,
      to explain to her my<span class="pagenum">75</span><a name="link75"
      id="link75"></a> long and intimate connection with the family. Yet nothing
      I could say put a stop to &ldquo;How can you defend her in this?&mdash;how
      can you justify her in that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! that I cannot defend her is precisely the reason I can so ill
      bear to speak of her.&rdquo; How differently and how sweetly has the queen
      conducted herself&mdash;upon this occasion! Eager to see the &ldquo;Letters,&rdquo;
      she began reading them with the utmost avidity: a natural curiosity arose
      to be informed of several names and several particulars, which she knew I
      could satisfy; yet, when she perceived how tender a string she touched,
      she soon suppressed her inquiries, or only made them with so much
      gentleness towards the parties mentioned, that I could not be distressed
      in my answers; and even In a short time I found her questions made so
      favourable a disposition, that I began secretly to rejoice in them, as the
      means by which I reaped opportunity of clearing several points that had
      been darkened by calumny, and of softening others that had been viewed
      wholly through false lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jan. 10.&mdash;When we were summoned to the tea-room I met Miss de Luc
      coming out. I asked if she did not stay tea? &ldquo;O How can I,&rdquo;
      cried she, in a voice of distress, &ldquo;when already, as there is
      company here without me, Mrs. Schwellenberg has asked me what I came for?&rdquo;
      I was quite shocked for her, and could only shrug in dismay and let her
      pass. When there is no one else she is courted to stay!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Fisher came soon after; and the Princesses Augusta and Amelia
      fetched away Mrs. Delany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after Colonel Wellbred came, ushering in Mr. Fairly and his young
      son, who is at Eton school. I had seen Mr. F. but once since his great and
      heavy loss, though now near half a year had elapsed. So great a personal
      alteration in a few months I have seldom seen: thin, haggard, worn with
      care, grief, and watching&mdash;his hair turned grey&mdash;white, rather,
      and some of his front teeth vanished. He seemed to have suffered, through
      his feelings, the depredations suffered by Others through age and time.
      His demeanour, upon this trying occasion, filled me with as much
      admiration as his countenance did with compassion: calm, composed, and
      gentle, he seemed bent on appearing not only resigned, but cheerful. I
      might even have supposed him verging on being happy, had not the havoc of
      grief on his face, and the tone of deep melancholy in his voice, assured
      me his Solitude was all sacred to his sorrows.<span class="pagenum">76</span><a
      name="link76" id="link76"></a> Mr. Fisher was very sad himself, grieving
      at the death of Dr. Harley, Dean of Windsor and Bishop of Hereford. He
      began, however, talking to me of these &ldquo;Letters,&rdquo; and, with
      him, I could speak of them, and of their publisher, without reserve: but
      the moment they were named Mrs. Schwellenberg uttered such hard and harsh
      things, that I could not keep my seat and the less, because, knowing my
      strong friendship there in former days, I was sure it was meant I should
      be hurt, I attempted not to speak, well aware all defence is irritation,
      where an attack is made from ill-nature, not justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentle Mr. Fisher, sorry for the cause and the effect of this assault,
      tried vainly to turn it aside: what began with censure soon proceeded to
      invective; and at last, being really sick from crowding recollections of
      past scenes, where the person now thus vilified had been dear and precious
      to my very heart, I was forced, abruptly, to walk out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indifferent to me whether or not my retreat was noticed. I have
      never sought to disguise the warm friendship that once subsisted between
      Mrs. Thrale and myself, for I always hoped that, where it was known,
      reproach might be spared to a name I can never hear without a secret pang,
      even when simply mentioned. Oh, then, how severe a one is added, when its
      sound is accompanied by the hardest aspersions!
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned when I could, and the subject was over. When all were gone Mrs.
      Schwellenberg said, &ldquo;I have told it Mr. Fisher that he drove you out
      from the room, and he says he won&rsquo;t not do it no more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She told me next&mdash;that in the second volume I also was mentioned.
      Where she may have heard this I cannot gather, but it has given me a
      sickness at heart inexpressible. It is not that I expect severity: for at
      the time of that correspondence&mdash;at all times, indeed, previous to
      the marriage with Piozzi, if Mrs. Thrale loved not F. B., where shall we
      find faith in words, or give credit to actions? But her present
      resentment, however unjustly incurred, of my constant disapprobation of
      her conduct, may prompt some note, or other mark, to point out her change
      of sentiments&mdash;but let me try to avoid such painful expectations; at
      least, not to dwell upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      O, little does she know how tenderly at this moment I could run again into
      her arms, so often opened to receive me with a cordiality I believed
      inalienable. And it was sincere then, I am satisfied: pride, resentment of
      disapprobation, and consciousness of unjustifiable proceedings&mdash;these
      have now<span class="pagenum">77</span><a name="link77" id="link77"></a>
      changed her: but if we met, and she saw and believed my faithful regard,
      how would she again feel all her own return!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what a dream am I making!
    </p>
    <p>
      Jan. 11.&mdash;Upon this ever-interesting subject, I had to-day a very
      sweet scene with the queen. While Mrs. Schwellenberg and myself were both
      in our usual attendance at noon, her majesty inquired of Mrs.
      Schwellenberg if she had yet read any of the &ldquo;Letters&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I have them not to read.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I then said she had been so obliging as to lend them to me, to whom they
      were undoubtedly of far greater personal value.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the queen; &ldquo;for I think there is
      but little in them that can be of much consequence or value to the public
      at large.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, you will hurt Miss Burney if you speak about that;
      poor Miss Burney will be quite hurt by that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen looked much surprised, and I hastily exclaimed, &ldquo;O, no!&mdash;not
      with the gentleness her majesty names it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schwellenberg then spoke in German; and, I fancy, by the names she
      mentioned, recounted how Mr. Turbulent and Mr. Fisher had &ldquo;driven me
      out of the room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen seemed extremely astonished, and I was truly vexed at this total
      misunderstanding; and that the goodness she has exerted upon this occasion
      should seem so little to have succeeded. But I could not explain, lest it
      should seem to reproach what was meant as kindness in Mrs. Schwellenberg,
      who had not yet discovered that it was not the subject, but her own manner
      of treating it, that was so painful to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the instant Mrs. Schwellenberg left the room, and we remained
      alone, the queen, approaching me in the softest manner, and looking
      earnestly in my face, said, &ldquo;You could not be offended, surely, at
      what I said.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; cried I, deeply indeed penetrated by such
      unexpected condescension. &ldquo;I have been longing to make a speech to
      your majesty upon this matter; and it was but yesterday that I entreated
      Mrs. Delany to make it for me, and to express to your majesty the very
      deep sense I feel of the lenity with which this Subject has been treated
      in my hearing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; cried she, with eyes strongly expressive of the
      complacency with which she heard me, &ldquo;I have always spoke as little
      as possible upon this affair. I remember but twice that I have named it:
      once I said to the Bishop of Carlisle,<span class="pagenum">78</span><a
      name="link78" id="link78"></a> that I thought most of these letters had
      better have been spared the printing; and once to Mr. Langton, at the
      Drawing-room, I said, &lsquo;Your friend Dr. Johnson, sir, has had many
      friends busy to publish his books, and his memoirs, and his meditations,
      and his thoughts; but I think he wanted one friend more.&rsquo; &lsquo;What
      for? ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; cried he; &lsquo;A friend to suppress them,&rsquo;
      I answered. And, indeed, this is all I ever said about the business.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A PAIR OF PARAGONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was amply recompensed in spending an evening the most to my natural
      taste of any I have spent officially under the royal roof. How high
      Colonel Wellbred stands with me you know; Mr. Fairly, with equal
      gentleness, good breeding, and delicacy, adds a far more general turn for
      conversation, and seemed not only ready, but pleased, to open upon
      subjects of such serious import as were suited to his state of mind, and
      could not but be edifying, from a man of such high moral character, to all
      who heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life and death were the deep themes to which he led; and the little space
      between them, and the little value of that space were the subject of his
      comments. The unhappiness of man at least after the ardour of his first
      youth, and the near worthlessness of the world, seemed so deeply impressed
      on his mind, that no reflection appeared to be consolatory to it, save the
      necessary shortness of our mortal career....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is no time&mdash;I know of
      none&mdash;in which life is well worth having. The prospect before us is
      never such as to make it worth preserving, except from religious motives.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt shocked and sorry. Has he never tasted happiness, who so deeply
      drinks of sorrow? He surprised me, and filled me, indeed, with equal
      wonder and pity. At a loss how to make an answer sufficiently general, I
      made none at all, but referred to Colonel Wellbred: perhaps he felt the
      same difficulty, for he said nothing; and Mr. Fairly then gathered an
      answer for himself, by saying, &ldquo;Yes, it may, indeed, be attainable
      in the only actual as well as only right way to seek it,&mdash;that of
      doing good!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; cried Colonel Wellbred, afterwards, &ldquo;I lived
      always in London, I should be as tired of life as you are: I always sicken
      of it there, if detained beyond a certain time."<span class="pagenum">79</span><a
      name="link79" id="link79"></a> They then joined in a general censure of
      dissipated life, and a general distaste of dissipated characters, which
      seemed, however, to comprise almost all their acquaintance; and this
      presently occasioned Mr. Fairly to say,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, however, but fair for you and me to own, Wellbred, that if
      people in general, are bad, we live chiefly amongst those who are the
      worst.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether he meant any particular set to which they belong, or whether his
      reflection went against people in high life, such &lsquo;as constitute
      their own relations and connexions in general, I cannot say, as he did not
      explain himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairly, besides the attention due to him from all, in consideration of
      his late loss, merited from me peculiar deference, in return for a mark I
      received of his disposition to think favourably of me from our first
      acquaintance: for not more was I surprised than pleased at his opening
      frankly upon the character of my coadjutrix, and telling me at once, that
      when first he saw me here, just before the Oxford expedition, he had
      sincerely felt for and pitied me....
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday, Jan. 13.&mdash;There is something in Colonel Wellbred so elegant,
      so equal, and so pleasing, it is impossible not to see him with
      approbation, and to speak of him with praise. But I found in Mr. Fairly a
      much greater depth of understanding, and all his sentiments seem formed
      upon the most perfect basis of religious morality.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the evening, in talking over plays and players, we all three united
      warmly in panegyric of Mrs. Siddons; but when Mrs. Jordan was named, Mr.
      Fairly and myself were left to make the best of her. Observing the silence
      of Colonel Wellbred, we called upon him to explain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen her,&rdquo; he answered, quietly, &ldquo;but in one
      part.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever it was,&rdquo; cried Mr. Fairly, &ldquo;it must have been
      well done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the colonel, &ldquo;and so well that it seemed
      to be her real character: and I disliked her for that very reason, for it
      was a character that, off the stage or on, is equally distasteful to me&mdash;a
      hoyden.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had had a little of this feeling myself when I saw her in &ldquo;The
      Romp,"<a href="#linknote-251" name="linknoteref-251" id="linknoteref-251"><small>251</small></a>
      where she gave me, in the early part, a real disgust; but afterwards she
      displayed such uncommon humour that it brought me to pardon her assumed
      vulgarity, in favour of a representation of nature, which, In its
      particular class, seemed to me quite perfect.<span class="pagenum">80</span><a
      name="link80" id="link80"></a> MR. TURBULENT&rsquo;S SELF CONDEMNATION.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the usual tea-time I sent Columb, to see if anybody had come upstairs.
      He brought me word the eating-parlour was empty. I determined to go
      thither at once, with my work, that there might be no pretence to fetch me
      when the party assembled; but upon opening the door I saw Mr. Turbulent
      there, and alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      I entered with readiness into discourse with him, and showed a disposition
      to placid good-will, for with so irritable a spirit resentment has much
      less chance to do good than an appearance of not supposing it deserved.
      Our conversation was in the utmost gravity. He told me he was not happy,
      though owned he had everything to make him so; but he was firmly persuaded
      that happiness in this world was a real stranger. I combated this
      misanthropy in general terms; but he assured me that such was his
      unconquerable opinion of human life.
    </p>
    <p>
      How differently did I feel when I heard an almost similar sentiment from
      Mr. Fairly! In him I imputed it to unhappiness of circumstances, and was
      filled with compassion for his fate: in this person I impute it to
      something blameable within, and I tried by all the arguments I could
      devise to give him better notions. For him, however, I soon felt pity,
      though not of the same composition: for he frankly said he was good enough
      to be happy-that he thought human frailty incompatible with happiness, and
      happiness with human frailty, and that he had no wish so strong as to turn
      monk!
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him if he thought a life of uselessness and of goodness the same
      thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need not be useless,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I might assist by my
      counsels. I might be good in a monastery&mdash;in the world I cannot! I am
      not master of my feelings: I am run away by passions too potent for
      control!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a most unwelcome species of confidence, but I affected to treat
      it as mere talk, and answered it only slightly, telling him he spoke from
      the gloom of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I have tried in vain to conquer
      them. I have made vows&mdash;resolutions&mdash;all in vain! I cannot keep
      them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not weakness,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;sometimes fancied, merely
      to save the pain and trouble of exerting fortitude.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is with me inevitable. I am not formed for success in
      self-conquest. I resolve&mdash;I repent&mdash;but I fall! I blame&mdash;<span
      class="pagenum">81</span><a name="link81" id="link81"></a> reproach&mdash;I
      even hate myself&mdash;I do everything, in short, yet cannot save myself!
      Yet do not,&rdquo; he continued, seeing me shrink, &ldquo;think worse of
      me than I deserve: nothing of injustice, of ill-nature, of malignancy&mdash;I
      have nothing of these to reproach myself with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;and surely, therefore, a
      general circumspection, an immediate watchfulness&mdash;-&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no&mdash;&lsquo;twould be all to no purpose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis that hopelessness which is most your enemy. If you would
      but exert your better reason&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam, no!&mdash;&rsquo;tis a fruitless struggle. I know myself
      too well&mdash;I can do nothing so right as to retire&mdash;to turn monk&mdash;hermit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no respect,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;for these selfish
      seclusions. I can never suppose we were created in the midst of society,
      in order to run away to a useless solitude. I have not a doubt but you may
      do well, if you will do well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after he suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;Have you&mdash;tell me&mdash;have
      you, ma&rsquo;am, never done what you repent?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      O &ldquo;yes!&mdash;at times.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have?&rdquo; he cried, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes, alas!&mdash;yet not, I think, very often&mdash;for it is not
      very often I have done anything!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is it has saved you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I really did not know well what to answer him; I could say nothing that
      would not sound like parade, or implied superiority. I suppose he was
      afraid himself of the latter; for, finding me silent, he was pleased to
      answer for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prejudice, education, accident!&mdash;those have saved you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; cried I. &ldquo;And one thing more, I
      acknowledge myself obliged to, on various occasions&mdash;fear. I run no
      risks that I see&mdash;I run&mdash;but it is always away from all danger
      that I perceive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not, however, call that virtue, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;you do not
      call that the rule of right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I dare not&mdash;I must be content that it is certainly
      not the rule of wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He began then an harangue upon the universality of depravity and frailty
      that I heard with much displeasure; for, it seems to me, those most
      encourage such general ideas of general worthlessness who most wish to
      found upon them partial excuses for their own.<span class="pagenum">82</span><a
      name="link82" id="link82"></a> MISS BURNEY AMONG HER OLD FRIENDS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jan. 31.&mdash;-And now I must finish my account of this month by my own
      assembly at my dear Mrs. Ord&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed through the friendly hands of Miss Ord to the most cordial ones
      of Mrs. Garrick,<a href="#linknote-252" name="linknoteref-252"
      id="linknoteref-252"><small>252</small></a> who frankly embraced me,
      saying, &ldquo;Do I see you, once more, before I die, my tear little
      spark? for your father is my flame, all my life, and you are a little
      spark of that flame!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She added how much she had wished to visit me at the queen&rsquo;s house,
      when she found I no longer came about the world; but that she was too
      discreet, and I did not dare say &ldquo;Do come!&rdquo; unauthorized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came Mr. Pepys, and he spoke to me instantly, of the &lsquo;Streatham
      Letters.&rsquo; He is in agony as to his own fate, but said there could be
      no doubt of my faring well. Not, I assured him, to my own content, if
      named at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were interrupted by Sir Joshua Reynolds. I was quite glad to see him;
      and we began chatting with all our old spirit, and he quite raved against
      my present life of confinement, an the invisibility it had occasioned,
      etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The approach of Mrs. Porteus stopped this. She is always most obliging and
      courteous, and she came to inquire whether now she saw I really was not
      wholly immured, there was any chance of a more intimate cultivation of an
      acquaintance long begun, but stopped in its first progress. I could only
      make a general answer of acknowledgment to her kindness. Her bishop, whom
      I had not seen since his preferment from Chester to London, joined us, and
      most good-naturedly entered into discourse upon my health.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was next called to Mrs. Montagu, who was behind with no one in kind
      speeches, and who insisted upon making me a visit at the queen&rsquo;s
      house, and would take no denial to my fixing my own time, whenever I was
      at leisure, and sending her word; and she promised to put off any and
      every engagement for that Purpose. I could make no other return to such<span
      class="pagenum">83</span><a name="link83" id="link83"></a> civility, but
      to desire to postpone it till my dear Mr. and Mrs. Locke came to town, and
      could meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boscawen<a href="#linknote-253" name="linknoteref-253"
      id="linknoteref-253"><small>253</small></a> was my next little
      tete-a-tete, but I had only begun it when Mr. Cambridge came to my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get a word!&rdquo; cried he, with a most forlorn
      look, &ldquo;and yet I came on purpose!&rdquo; I thanked him, and felt
      such a real pleasure in his sight, from old and never-varying regard, that
      I began to listen to him with my usual satisfaction. He related to me a
      long history of Lavant, where the new-married Mrs. Charles Cambridge is
      now very unwell: and then he told me many good things of his dear and
      deserving daughter; and I showed him her muff, which she had worked for
      me, in embroidery, and we were proceeding a little in the old way, when I
      saw Mrs. Pepys leaning forward to hear us; and then Lady Rothes, who also
      seemed all attention to Mr. Cambridge and his conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweet Lady Mulgrave came for only a few words, not to take me, she
      said, from older claimants; the good and wise Mrs. Carter<a
      href="#linknote-254" name="linknoteref-254" id="linknoteref-254"><small>254</small></a>
      expressed herself with equal kindness and goodness on our once more
      meeting; Miss Port, looking beautiful as a little angel, only once
      advanced to shake hands, and say, &ldquo;I can see you another time, so I
      won&rsquo;t be unreasonable now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smelt, who came from Kew for this party, made me the same speech, and
      no more, and I had time for nothing beyond a &ldquo;how do do&rdquo; with
      Mr. Langton, his Lady Rothes,<a href="#linknote-255" name="linknoteref-255"
      id="linknoteref-255"><small>255</small></a> Mr. Batt, Mr. Cholmondoley,
      Lord Mulgrave, Sir Lucas Pepys, and Lady Herries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then up came Mrs. Chapone, and, after most cordially shaking hands with
      me, &ldquo;But I hope,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you are not always to
      appear only as a comet, to be stared at, and then vanish? If you are, let
      me beg at least to be brushed by your tail, and not hear you have
      disappeared before my telescope is ready for looking at you!&rdquo; When
      at last I was able to sit down, after a short conference with every one,
      it was next to Mr. Walpole,<a href="#linknote-256" name="linknoteref-256"
      id="linknoteref-256"><small>256</small></a> who had secured<span
      class="pagenum">84</span><a name="link84" id="link84"></a> me a place by
      his side; and with him was my longest conversation, for he was in high
      spirits, polite, ingenious, entertaining, quaint, and original.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all was so short!&mdash;so short!&mdash;I was forced to return home so
      soon! ‘Twas, however, a very great regale to me, and the sight of so much
      kindness, preserved so entire after so long an absence, warmed my whole
      heart with pleasure and satisfaction. My dearest father brought me home.

    <h2>
      SOME TRIVIAL COURT INCIDENTS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Friday, Feb. 1.&mdash;To-day I had a summons in the morning to Mrs.
      Schwellenberg, who was very ill; so ill as to fill me with compassion. She
      was extremely low-spirited, and spoke to me with quite unwonted kindness
      of manner, and desired me to accept a sedan-chair, which had been Mrs.
      Haggerdorn&rsquo;s, and now devolved to her, saying, I might as well have
      it while she lived as when she was dead, which would soon happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked her, and wished her, I am sure very sincerely, better. Nor do I
      doubt her again recovering, as I have frequently seen her much worse.
      True, she must die at last, but who must not?
    </p>
    <p>
      Feb. 2.&mdash;The king always makes himself much diversion with Colonel
      Goldsworthy, whose dryness of humour and pretended servility of
      submission, extremely entertain him. He now attacked him upon the enormous
      height of his collar, which through some mistake of his tailor, exceeded
      even the extremity of fashion. And while the king, who was examining and
      pulling it about, had his back to us, Colonel Wellbred had the malice to
      whisper me, &ldquo;Miss Burney, I do assure you it is nothing to what it
      was; he has had two inches cut off since morning!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, as Colonel Wellbred stood next me, this was not heard for the
      king would not easily have forgotten. He soon after went away, but gave no
      summons to his gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Colonel Wellbred gave me another proof of his extraordinary powers
      of seeing. You now know, my dear friends, that in the king&rsquo;s
      presence everybody retreats back, as far as they can go, to leave him the
      room to himself. In all this, through the disposition of the chairs, I was
      placed so much behind Colonel Wellbred as to conclude myself out of his
      sight; but the moment the king retired, he said, as<span class="pagenum">85</span><a
      name="link85" id="link85"></a> we all dropped on Our seats, &ldquo;Everybody
      is tired&mdash;Miss Burney the most&mdash;for she has stood the stillest.
      Miss Planta has leant on her chair, Colonel Goldsworthy against the wall,
      myself occasionally on the screen, but Miss Burney has stood perfectly
      still&mdash;I perceived that without looking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tis, indeed, to us standers, an amazing addition to fatigue to keep
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      We returned to town next day. In the morning I had had a very
      disagreeable, though merely foolish, embarrassment. Detained, by the
      calling in of a poor woman about a subscription, from dressing myself, I
      was forced to run to the queen, at her summons, without any cap. She
      smiled, but said nothing. Indeed, she is all indulgence in those points of
      externals, which rather augments than diminishes my desire of showing
      apparent as well as my feeling of internal respect but just as I had
      assisted her with her peignoir, Lady Effingham was admitted, and the
      moment she sat down, and the hair-dresser began his office, a page
      announced the Duke of York, who instantly followed his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have given the world to have run away, but the common door of
      entrance and exit was locked, unfortunately, on account of the coldness of
      the day; and there was none to pass, but that by which his royal highness
      entered, and was standing. I was forced, therefore, to remain, and wait
      for dismission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I was pleased, too, by the sight of his affectionate manner to his
      royal mother. He flew to take and kiss her hand, but she gave him her
      cheek; and then he began a conversation with her, so open and so gay, that
      he seemed talking to the most intimate associate.
    </p>
    <p>
      His subject was Lady Augusta Campbell&rsquo;s elopement from the
      masquerade. The Duchess of Ancaster had received masks at her house on
      Monday, and sent tickets to all the queen&rsquo;s household. I, amongst
      the rest, had one; but it was impossible I could be spared at such an
      hour, though the queen told me that she had thought of my going, but could
      not manage it, as Mrs. Schwellenberg was so ill. Miss Planta went, and I
      had the entire equipment of her. I started the Project of dressing her at
      Mrs. Delany&rsquo;s, in all the most antique and old-fashioned things we
      could borrow; and this was Put very happily in execution, for she was, I
      have heard, one of the best and most grotesque figures in the room. <span

    <h2>
      SECTION 12. (1788.) THE TRIAL OF WARREN HASTINGS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Probably few events in the history of England are more familiar to the
      general reader than the trial of Warren Hastings. If nowhere else, at
      least in the best known and, perhaps, most brilliant of Macaulay&rsquo;s
      essays every one has read of the career of that extraordinary man, and of
      the long contest in Westminster Hall, from which he came forth acquitted,
      after an ordeal of seven years&rsquo; duration. We shall, accordingly,
      confine our remarks upon this subject within the narrowest limits
      consistent with intelligibility: Fanny&rsquo;s experiences of the trial,
      recorded in the following pages, rendering some review of the proceedings
      which caused it here indispensable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warren Hastings was a lad of seventeen when, in 1750, he was first sent
      out to India as a writer in the East India Company&rsquo;s service. His
      abilities attracted the notice of Clive, and, after the downfall of the
      Nawab Suraj-u-Dowlah, Hastings was chosen to represent the Company at the
      Court of Mir Jafir, the new Nawab of Bengal. In 1761 he was appointed
      Member of Council at Calcutta, and he returned to England in 1765, unknown
      as yet to fame, but with an excellent reputation both for efficiency and
      integrity. He left Bengal in a state of anarchy. The actual power was in
      the possession of a trading company, whose objects were at once to fill
      their coffers, and to avoid unnecessary political complications. The show
      of authority was invested in a Nawab who was a mere puppet in the hands of
      the English company. Disorder was rampant throughout the provinces, and
      the unhappy Hindoos, unprotected by their native princes, were left a
      helpless prey to the rapacity of their foreign tyrants.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a time when to enrich himself with the plunder of the natives was the
      aim of every servant of the East India Company, it is much to the honour
      of Hastings that he returned home a comparatively poor man. In England he
      indulged his taste for literary society, busied himself with a scheme for
      introducing at<span class="pagenum">87</span><a name="link87" id="link87"></a>
      oxford the study of the Persian language and literature, and made the
      acquaintance of Dr. Johnson. But generosity and imprudence together soon
      reduced his small means. He applied to the Directors of the Company for
      employment, was appointed to a seat on the Council at Madras, and made his
      second voyage to India in 1769. Among his fellow-passengers on board the
      &ldquo;Duke of Grafton&rdquo; was Madame Imhoff, whom he afterwards
      married.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Madras Hastings managed the export business of the Company with
      conspicuous success, and so completely to the satisfaction of the
      Directors, that, two years later, he was promoted to the governorship of
      Bengal, and sent to exercise his administrative ability and genius for
      reform&mdash;there they were then greatly needed-at Calcutta. With this
      appointment his historic career may be said to commence. He found himself
      at the outset in a situation of extreme difficulty. He was required to
      establish something resembling a stable government in place of the
      prevailing anarchy, and, above all things, with disordered finances, to
      satisfy the expectations of his&rsquo; employers by constant remittances
      of money. Both these tasks he accomplished, but the difficulties in the
      way of the latter led him to the commission of those acts for which he was
      afterwards denounced by his enemies as a monster of injustice and
      barbarity. Hastings&rsquo;s conduct with respect to the Great Mogul has
      been sketched by Macaulay in words which imply a reprehension in reality
      undeserved. Little remained at this time of the magnificent empire of
      Aurungzebe beyond a title and a palace at Delhi. In 1765 Lord Clive had
      ceded to the titular master of the Mogul empire the districts of Corah and
      Allahabad, lying to the south of Oude, and westwards of Benares. The
      cession had been made in pursuance of the same policy which Hastings
      afterwards followed; that, namely, of sheltering the British possessions
      behind a barrier of friendly states, which should be sufficiently strong
      to withstand the incursions of their hostile neighbours, and particularly
      of the Mahrattas, the most warlike and dreaded of the native powers. But
      Clive&rsquo;s purpose had been completely frustrated; for the Mogul, far
      from shielding the English, had not been able to hold his own against the
      Mahrattas, to whom he had actually ceded the very territories made over to
      him by the Company. Under these circumstances the English authorities can
      hardly be blamed for causing their troops to re-occupy the districts in
      question, nor can it fairly be imputed as a crime to Hastings that in
      September, 1773, he concluded with the Vizier of Oude the treaty of
      Benares, by which he sold Allahabad and Corah to that friendly potentate
      for about half a million sterling.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next act of foreign policy on the part of the Governor of Bengal&mdash;his
      share in the subjugation of the Rohillas&mdash;does not admit of so
      favourable an interpretation. The Rohillas occupied territory lying under
      the southern slopes of the Himalayas, to the north-west of Oude. The
      dominant race in Rohilcund was of<span class="pagenum">88</span><a
      name="link88" id="link88"></a> Afghan origin, although the majority of the
      population was Hindoo. Of the rulers of Rohilcund Hastings himself wrote,
      in terms which we may accept as accurate, &ldquo;They are a tribe of
      Afghans or Pathans, freebooters who conquered the country about sixty
      years ago, and have ever since lived upon the fruits of it, without
      contributing either to its cultivation or manufactures, or even mixing
      with the native inhabitants."<a href="#linknote-257" name="linknoteref-257"
      id="linknoteref-257"><small>257</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1772, the Rohillas, hard pressed by their foes, the Mahrattas, sought
      the assistance of the Vizier of Oude, Shuja-u-Dowlah, to whom they agreed
      to pay, in return for his aid, a large sum of money. This agreement was
      signed in the presence of an English general, and an English brigade
      accompanied the vizier&rsquo;s army, which co-operated with the Rohilla
      forces, and obliged the Mahrattas to withdraw. But when Shula-u-Dowlah
      demanded his promised hire, he received from the Rohillas plenty of
      excuses but no money. Hereupon he resolved to annex Rohilcund to his own
      dominions, and, to ensure success, he concerted measures with Hastings,
      who, willing at once to strengthen a friendly power and to put money into
      his own exchequer, placed an English brigade at the vizier&rsquo;s
      disposal for a consideration Of 400,000 pounds. In the spring of 1774 the
      invasion took place. The desperate bravery of the Rohillas was of no avail
      against English discipline, and the country was so reduced to submission.
      Macaulay&rsquo;s stirring account of the barbarities practised by the
      invaders has been proved to be greatly exaggerated. Disorders, however,
      there were: the people were plundered, and some of the villages were burnt
      by the vizier&rsquo;s troops. Many of the Rohilla families were exiled,
      but the Hindoo inhabitants of Rohilcund were left to till their fields as
      before, and were probably not greatly affected by their change of master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastings&rsquo;s conduct in this affair is, from the most favourable point
      of view, rather to be excused than applauded. It may have been politic
      under the circumstances, but it was hardly in accordance with a high
      standard of morality to let out on hire an English force for the
      subjugation of a people who, whatever grounds of complaint the Vizier of
      Oude might have had against them, had certainly given no provocation
      whatsoever to the English Government. As to the plea which has been put
      forward in his favour, that the Rohillas were merely the conquerors, and
      not the original owners of Rohilcund, it is sufficiently answered, by
      Macaulay&rsquo;s query, &ldquo;What were the English themselves?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1773 Lord North&rsquo;s &ldquo;Regulating Act&rdquo; introduced
      considerable changes in the constitution of the Indian government, and
      marked the first step in the direction of a transfer of the control over
      Indian affairs from the Company to the Crown. By this act &ldquo;the
      governorship of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa was vested in the
      Governor-General, with four Councillors, having authority over<span
      class="pagenum">89</span><a name="link89" id="link89"></a> Madras and
      Bombay; and all correspondence relating to civil government or military
      affairs was to be laid by the Directors of the Company in London before
      his-Majesty&rsquo;s Ministers, who Could disapprove or cancel any rules or
      orders. A Supreme Court of judicature, appointed by the Crown, was
      established in Calcutta."<a href="#linknote-258" name="linknoteref-258"
      id="linknoteref-258"><small>258</small></a> The Governor-General was
      appointed for a term of five years, and the first Governor-General was
      Hastings. Of the four councillors with whom he was associated, three were
      sent out from England to take their places at the board, and landed at
      Calcutta, together with the judges of the Supreme Court, in October, 1771.
      Indisputably the ablest, and, as it proved, historically the most
      noteworthy of these three, was Philip Francis, the supposed author of
      &ldquo;Junius&rsquo;s Letters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even before the council commenced its duties dissensions arose. The
      newcomers, Francis, Clavering, and Monson, were in constant opposition to
      the Governor-General. Indeed, the hostility between Hastings and Francis
      rose by degrees to such a height that, some years later, they met in a
      duel, in which Francis was severely wounded. For the present, however, the
      opponents of Hastings formed a majority on the council, and his authority
      was in eclipse. His ill-wishers in the country began to bestir themselves,
      and a scandalous and, there is no doubt, utterly untrue charge of
      accepting bribes was brought against him by an old enemy, the Maharajah
      Nuncomar. Hastings replied by prosecuting Nuncomar and his allies for
      conspiracy. The accused were admitted to bail, but a little later Nuncomar
      was arrested on a charge of having forged a bond some years previously,
      tried before an English jury, condemned to death, and hanged, August 5,
      1775, his application for leave to appeal having been rejected by the
      Chief justice, Sir Elijah Impey. Hastings solemnly declared his innocence
      of any share in this transaction, nor is there any evidence directly
      implicating him. On the other hand, it must be remembered that Nuncomar
      had preferred a most serious charge against Hastings; that the majority on
      the council were only too ready to listen to any charge, well or ill
      founded, against the Governor-General; and that Nuncomar&rsquo;s triumph
      would, in all probability, have meant Hastings&rsquo;s ruin. Even Mr.
      Forrest admits that &ldquo;it is extremely probable, as Francis stated,
      that if Nuncomar had never stood forth in politics, his other offences
      would not have hurt him."<a href="#linknote-259" name="linknoteref-259"
      id="linknoteref-259"><small>259</small></a> Macaulay comments upon the
      scandal of this stringent enforcement Of the English law against forgery
      under circumstances so peculiar, and in a country where the English law
      was totally unknown.<a href="#linknote-260" name="linknoteref-260"
      id="linknoteref-260"><small>260</small></a> That Nuncomar was fairly tried
      and convicted<span class="pagenum">90</span><a name="link90" id="link90"></a>
      in the ordinary course of law is now beyond doubt, but we still hold that
      it was Impey&rsquo;s clear duty to respite his prisoner. That he did not
      do so is a fact which, beyond all others, gave colour to the assertion of
      Hastings&rsquo;s enemies, that the execution of Nuncomar was the result of
      a secret understanding between the Governor-General of Bengal and the
      Chief justice of the Supreme Court. But, however brought about, the death
      of Nuncomar was to the opponents of Hastings a blow from which they never
      recovered. The death of Monson, in September, 1776, and that of Clavering,
      a year later, placed him in a majority on the council; his authority was
      more undisputed than ever; and at the expiration of his term he was
      re-appointed Governor-General.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the years 1780 and 1781 British rule in India passed through the
      most dangerous crisis that had befallen it since the days of Clive. A
      formidable confederacy had been formed between the Nizam, the Mahrattas,
      and the famous Hyder Ali, Sultan of Mysore, with the object of crushing
      their common enemy, the English. The hostility of these powerful states
      had been provoked by the blundering and bad faith of the governments of
      Bombay and Madras, which had made, and broken, treaties with each of them
      in turn. &ldquo;As to the Mahrattas,&rdquo; to quote the words of Burke,
      &ldquo;they had so many cross treaties with the states general of that
      nation, and with each of the chiefs, that it was notorious that no one of
      these agreements could be kept without grossly violating the rest."<a
      href="#linknote-261" name="linknoteref-261" id="linknoteref-261"><small>261</small></a>
      The war in which the Bombay Government had engaged with the Mahrattas had
      been as unsuccessful in its prosecution as it was impolitic in its
      commencement, until, early in 1780, a force under General Goddard was
      dispatched from Bengal to co-operate with the Bombay troops. Goddard&rsquo;s
      arrival turned the tide of events. The province of Gujerat was reduced,
      the Mahratta chiefs, Sindia and Holkar, were defeated, and everything
      portended a favourable termination of the war, when the whole face of
      affairs was changed by news from the south.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hyder Ali, the most able and warlike of the native princes, swept down
      upon the Carnatic in July, 1780, at the head of a disciplined army of
      nearly 100,000 men. He was now an old man, but age had not broken his
      vigour. He rapidly overran the country; an English force, under Colonel
      Baillie, which opposed him, was cut to pieces, and Madras itself was
      threatened. The prompt measures adopted by Hastings on this occasion saved
      the colony. Reinforcements were hurried to Madras; the veteran, Sir Eyre
      Coote, was entrusted with the command of the army; and the triumphant<span
      class="pagenum">91</span><a name="link91" id="link91"></a> career of Hyder
      Ali was checked by the victory of Porto Novo, July 1st, 1781. The end of
      the war, however, was yet far off. Peace was concluded with the Mahrattas,
      on terms honourable to them, in 1782, but in the south the struggle was
      still maintained by Hyder Ali and his French allies, and after Hyder Ali&rsquo;s
      death, in December of that year, by his son Tippoo; nor was it brought to
      a termination until after the general peace Of 1783.
    </p>
    <p>
      To support the financial strain of these wars Hastings had recourse to
      measures which, with the colouring given to them by his enemies, gave
      subsequent rise to two of the heaviest charges brought forward by the
      managers of his impeachment. His first victim was Cheyt Sing, the Rajah of
      Benares, a tributary of the English Government. Cheyt Sing had been
      formerly a vassal of the Vizier of Oude, and when, in 1775, the vizier
      transferred his sovereign rights over Benares to the English, the Bengal
      Government confirmed the possession of the city and its dependencies to
      Cheyt Sing and his heirs for ever, stipulating only for the payment of an
      annual tribute, and undertaking that the regular payment of this tribute
      should acquit the Rajah of further obligations. It was afterwards
      contended on behalf of Hastings that this undertaking did not annul the
      right of the superior power to call upon its vassal for extraordinary aid
      on extraordinary occasions, and this view was upheld by Pitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastings began operations in 1778 by demanding of the Rajah, in addition
      to his settled tribute, a large contribution towards the war expenses. The
      sum was paid, but similar requisitions in the following years were met
      with procrastination or evasion, and a demand that the Rajah should
      furnish a contingent of cavalry was not complied with. This conduct on the
      part of Cheyt Sing appeared to the Governor-General and his Council
      &ldquo;to require early punishment, and, as his wealth was great and the
      Company&rsquo;s exigencies pressing,&rdquo; in 1781 a fine of fifty lakhs,
      of rupees (500,000 pounds) was laid upon the unlucky Rajah; Hastings
      himself proceeding to Benares, with a small escort, to enforce payment.
      Cheyt Sing received his unwelcome visitor with due respect, but with
      ambiguous answers, and Hastings, most imprudently, gave the order for the
      Rajah&rsquo;s arrest. The Rajah submitted, but his troops and the
      population of Benares rose to the rescue: a portion of Hastings&rsquo;s
      little force was massacred, the Rajah regained his liberty, and the
      Governor-General found safety only in flight. The insurrection rapidly
      spread to the country around, and assumed dangerous proportions, but the
      promptitude and vigour of-Hastings soon restored order. Cheyt Sing was
      deposed, compelled to flee his country, his estates were confiscated, and
      a new Rajah of Benares was appointed in his stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The charge subsequently preferred against Hastings in connection with this
      affair turned upon the question whether Cheyt Sing Was, as the prosecutors
      affirmed, a sovereign prince who owed no duty to the Bengal government
      beyond the payment (which he<span class="pagenum">92</span><a name="link92"
      id="link92"></a> had regularly performed) of a fixed annual tribute; or as
      Hastings contended, a mere feudal vassal, bound to furnish aid when called
      upon by his over-lord. Pitt, as we have said, took the latter view, yet he
      gave his support to the charge on the ground that the fine imposed upon
      the Rajah of Benares was excessive., Upon the whole, it would appear that
      Hastings was acting within his rights in demanding an extraordinary
      subsidy from the Rajah but the enormous amount of the fine, and the
      harshness and in&rsquo; dignity with which Cheyt Sing was treated, point
      to a determination on the part of the Governor-General to ruin a subject
      prince, with whom, moreover, it was known he had personal grounds of
      pique.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deposition of Cheyt Sing was followed by an act on which was
      afterwards founded the most sensational of all the charges brought against
      Warren Hastings. Shuja-u-Dowlah, the Nawab Vizier of Oude, to whom
      Hastings had sold the Rohillas, died in 1775, and was succeeded by his son
      Asaph-u-Dowlah. At the time of his death Shuja-u-Dowlah was deeply in
      debt, both to his own army and to the Bengal Government. The treasure
      which he left was estimated at two millions sterling, but this vast sum of
      money and certain rich estates were appropriated by his mother and widow,
      the begums, or princesses, of Oude, under the pretence of a will which may
      possibly have existed, but was certainly never Produced. With this wealth
      at their disposal the begums enjoyed a practical independence of the new
      vizier, who was no match in energy and resolution for his mother and
      grandmother. A small portion, however, of the money was paid over to the
      vizier, on the understanding, guaranteed by the Bengal Government, that
      the begums should be left in undisturbed enjoyment of the remainder of
      their possessions. Hastings believed, and, it would seem, on good grounds,
      that the younger begum had busied herself actively in fomenting the
      insurrection which broke out upon the arrest of Cheyt Sing at Benares. He
      conceived a plan by which he might at once punish the rebellious
      princesses, and secure for the exchequer at Calcutta the arrears of debt
      due from the Government of Oude. He withdrew the guarantee, and urged the
      Vizier to seize upon the estates possessed by the begums. Asaph-u-Dowlah
      came willingly into the arrangement, but, when it became necessary to act,
      his heart failed him. Hastings, however, was not to be trifled with.
      English troops were employed: the begums were closely confined in their
      palace at Fyzabad; and, to the lasting disgrace of Hastings, their
      personal attendants were starved and even tortured, until they consented
      to surrender their money and estates. Hastings&rsquo;s conduct in
      withdrawing the guarantee was not without justification; the means which
      he suffered to be employed in carrying out his purpose, and for the
      employment of which he must be held primarily responsible, were utterly
      indefensible.<span class="pagenum">93</span><a name="link93" id="link93"></a>
      Long before his return to England, the Governor-General&rsquo;s
      proceedings had engaged no little share of public attention in this
      country. In Parliament the attack was led by Burke and Fox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastings&rsquo;s chief defender was one Major Scott, an Indian officer
      whom he had sent over to England as his agent in 1780, and who maintained
      his patron&rsquo;s cause by voice and pen, in Parliament and in the press,
      with far more energy than discretion. In 1784 Mrs. Hastings arrived in
      England, bringing home with her, says Wraxall, &ldquo;about 40,000 pounds,
      acquired without her husband&rsquo;s privity or approval;&rdquo; and a
      year later her husband followed her, having resigned his
      Governor-Generalship. The fortune which he now possessed was moderate, his
      opportunities considered, and had been honourably acquired; for his
      motives had never been mercenary, and the money which he had wrung from
      Indian princes had invariably been applied to the service of the Company
      or the necessities of his administration. He was received with honour by
      the Directors and with favour by the Court. There was talk of a peerage
      for him, and he believed himself not only beyond danger, but in the direct
      road to reward and distinction. But all this was the calm which preceded
      the storm. The enemies of Hastings were active and bitterly in earnest,
      and they were receiving invaluable assistance from his old opponent in
      council, Francis, who had returned to England in 1781. In April, 1786, the
      charges, drawn up by Burke, were laid on the table of the House of
      Commons. The first charge, respecting the Rohilla war, was thrown out by
      the House, ministers siding with the accused. But on the second charge,
      relating to the Rajah of Benares, the Prime Minister, Pitt, declared
      against Hastings on the ground that, although the Governor-General had the
      right to impose a fine upon his vassal, the amount of the fine was
      excessive, and the motion was affirmed by a majority of forty votes. Early
      the next session, in February, 1787, Sheridan moved the third charge,
      touching the begums of Oude, in a speech which was pronounced the most
      brilliant ever delivered in the House of Commons. The majority against
      Hastings was on this occasion increased to one hundred and seven, Pitt, as
      before, supporting the motion. Other charges of oppression and corruption
      were then gone into and affirmed, and in May, by order of the House, Burke
      formally impeached Warren Hastings of high crimes and misdemeanours at the
      bar of the House of Lords. The accused was admitted to bail, himself in
      20,000 pounds, and two sureties in 10,000 pounds each. The Committee of
      Management, elected by the Commons to conduct the impeachment, included
      Burke and Fox, Sheridan and Windham, and the trial was opened before the
      Lords, in Westminster Hall, on the 13th of February, 1788.
    </p>
    <p>
      After two days occupied in reading the charges and the defendant&rsquo;s
      replies, Burke arose and opened the case for the prosecution in a speech
      full of eloquent exaggeration and honourable<span class="pagenum">94</span><a
      name="link94" id="link94"></a> zeal in the cause of an oppressed people.
      He spoke during days, after which the Benares charge was brought forward
      by Fox and Grey (afterwards Earl Grey), the youngest of the managers, and
      that relating to the Begums by Adam and Sheridan. The court then adjourned
      to the next session. But it is unnecessary here to follow the details of
      this famous trial which &ldquo;dragged its slow length along&rdquo; for
      seven years. In the spring of 1795 Hastings was acquitted, by a large
      majority, on all counts; and, although his conduct had, in some
      particulars, been far from faultless, and the sincerity of his principal
      accusers was beyond question, his acquittal must be owned as just as it
      was honourable, especially when we remember that his action had been
      entirely uninfluenced by considerations of private advantage, that he had
      endured for so many anxious years the burden of an impeachment, that he
      was ruined in fortune by the expenses of the trial, and that his great
      services to his country had been left wholly without reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      His poverty, however, was relieved by the Directors of the East India
      Company, who bestowed upon him a pension of 4,000 a year, and he passed
      the remainder of his long life in honourable retirement. He died in 1818,
      his wife, to whom he was always devotedly attached, surviving him by a few
      Years.

      visits to Westminster Hall during the early days of the trial. One other

    <h2>
      WESTMINSTER HALL AT THE OPENING OF THE HASTINGS TRIAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      February 13th. O what an interesting transaction does this day open! a
      day, indeed, of strong emotion to me, though all upon matters foreign to
      any immediate concern of my own&mdash;if anything may be called foreign
      that deeply interests us, merely because it is not personal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial, so long impending, of Mr. Hastings, opened to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen yesterday asked me if I wished to be present at the beginning,
      or had rather take another day. I was greatly obliged by her
      condescension, and preferred the opening. I thought it would give me a
      general view of the court, and the manner of proceeding, and that I might
      read hereafter the speeches and evidence. She then told me she had six
      tickets from Sir Peter Burrell, the grand chamberlain, for every day; that
      three were for his box, and three for his gallery. She asked me who I
      would go with, and promised me a box-ticket not only for myself, but my
      companion. Nor was this consideration all she showed me for she added,
      that as I might naturally wish for my father, she would have me send him
      my other ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked her very gratefully, and after dinner went to St. Martin&rsquo;s-street;
      but all there was embarrassing: my father could not go; he was averse to
      be present at the trial, and he was a little lame from a fall. In the end
      I sent an express to Hammersmith, to desire Charles<a href="#linknote-262"
      name="linknoteref-262" id="linknoteref-262"><small>262</small></a> to come
      to me the next morning by eight o&rsquo;clock. I was very sorry not to
      have my father, as he had been named by the queen; but I was glad to have
      Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her majesty at night the step I had ventured to take, and she was
      perfectly content with it. &ldquo;But I must trouble you,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;with Miss Gomme, who has no other way to go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning the queen dispensed with all attendance from me after her
      first dressing, that I might haste away. Mrs. Schwellenberg was
      fortunately well enough to take the whole duty, and the sweet queen not
      only hurried me off, but sent me some cakes from her own breakfast-table,
      that I might<span class="pagenum">96</span><a name="link96" id="link96"></a>
      carry them, in my pocket, lest I should have no time for eating before I
      went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles was not in time, but we all did well in the end We got to
      Westminster Hall between nine and ten O&rsquo;clock; and, as I know my
      dear Susan, like my-self, was never at a trial, I will give some account
      of the place and arrangements&rsquo;; and whether the description be new
      to her or old, my partial Fredy will not blame it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grand chamberlain&rsquo;s box Is in the centre of the upper end of the
      Hall: there we sat, Miss Gomme and myself, immediately behind the chair
      placed for Sir Peter Burrell. To the left, on the same level, were the
      green benches for the House of Commons, which occupied a third of the
      upper end of the Hall, and the whole of the left side: to the right of us,
      on the same level, was the grand chamberlain&rsquo;s gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The right side of the Hall, opposite to the green benches for the commons,
      was appropriated to the peeresses and peers&rsquo; daughters. The bottom
      of the Hall contained the royal family&rsquo;s box and the lord high
      steward&rsquo;s, above which was a large gallery appointed for receiving
      company with peers&rsquo; tickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gallery also was run along the left side of the Hall, above the green
      benches, which is called the Duke of Newcastle&rsquo;s box, the centre of
      which was railed off into a separate apartment for the reception of the
      queen and four eldest princesses, who were then incog., not choosing to
      appear in state, and in their own box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the right side of the Hall ran another gallery, over the seats of
      the peeresses, and this was divided into boxes for various people&mdash;the
      lord chamberlain, (not the great chamberlain,) the surveyor, architect,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for all the raised buildings; now for the disposition of the Hall
      itself, or ground. In the middle was placed a large table, and at the head
      of it the seat for the chancellor, and round it seats for the judges, the
      masters in chancery, the clerks, and all who belonged to the law; the
      upper end, and the right side of the room, was allotted to the peers in
      their robes; the left side to the bishops and archbishops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately below the great chamberlain&rsquo;s box was the place allotted
      for the prisoner. On his right side was a box for his own counsel, on his
      left the box for the managers, or committee, for the prosecution; and
      these three most important of all the divisions in the Hall were all
      directly adjoining to where I was seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost the moment I entered I was spoken to by a lady I<span
      class="pagenum">97</span><a name="link97" id="link97"></a> did not
      recollect, but found afterwards to be Lady Claremont and this proved very
      agreeable, for she took Sir Peter&rsquo;s place: and said she would occupy
      it till he claimed it; and then, when just before me, she named to me all
      the order of the buildings, and all the company, pointing out every
      distinguished person, and most obligingly desiring me to ask her any
      questions I wanted to have solved, as she knew, she said, &ldquo;all those
      creatures that filled the green benches, looking so little like gentlemen,
      and so much like hair-dressers,&rdquo; These were the Commons. In truth,
      she did the honours of the Hall to me with as much good nature and good
      breeding as if I had been a foreigner of distinction, to whom she had
      dedicated her time and attention. My acquaintance with her had been made
      formerly at Mrs. Vesey&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business did not begin till near twelve o&rsquo;clock. The opening to
      the whole then took place, by the entrance of the managers of the
      prosecution; all the company were already long in their boxes or
      galleries. I shuddered, and drew Involuntarily back, when, as the doors
      were flung open, I saw Mr. Burke, as head of the committee, make his
      solemn entry. He held a scroll in his hand, and walked alone, his brow
      knit with corroding care and deep labouring thought,&mdash;a brow how
      different to that which had proved so alluring to my warmest admiration
      when first I met him! so highly as he had been my favourite, so
      captivating as I had found his manners; and conversation in our first
      acquaintance, and so much as I had owed to his zeal and kindness to me and
      my affairs in its progress! How did I grieve to behold him now the cruel
      prosecutor (such to me he appeared) of an injured and innocent man!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fox followed next, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Windham, Messrs. Anstruther,
      Grey, Adam, Michael Angelo Taylor, Pelham, Colonel North, Mr. Frederick
      Montagu, Sir Gilbert Elliot, General Burgoyne, Dudley Long, etc. They were
      all named over to me by Lady Claremont, or I should not have recollected
      even those of my acquaintance, from the shortness of my sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the committee box was filled the House of Commons at large took their
      seats on their green benches, which stretched, as I have said, along the
      whole left side of the Hall, and, taking in a third of the upper end,
      joined to the great Chamberlain&rsquo;s box, from which nothing separated
      them but a Partition of about two feet in height.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then began the procession, the clerks entering first, then<span
      class="pagenum">98</span><a name="link98" id="link98"></a> the lawyers
      according to their rank, and the peers, bishops, and officers, all in
      their coronation robes; concluding with the princes of the blood,&mdash;Prince
      William, son to the Duke of Gloucester, coming first, then the Dukes of
      Cumberland, Gloucester, and York, then the Prince of Wales; and the whole
      ending by the chancellor, with his train borne. They then all took their
      seats.

    <h2>
      WARREN HASTINGS APPEARS AT THE BAR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A sergeant-at-arms arose, and commanded silence in court, on pain of
      imprisonment. Then some other officer, in a loud voice, called out, as
      well as I can recollect, words to this purpose:&mdash;&ldquo;Warren
      Hastings, esquire, come forth! Answer to the charges brought against you;
      save your bail, or forfeit your recognizance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed I trembled at these words, and hardly Could keep my place when I
      found Mr. Hastings was being brought to the bar. He came forth from some
      place immediately under the great chamberlain&rsquo;s box, and was
      preceded by Sir Francis Molyneux, gentleman-usher of the black rod; and at
      each side of him walked his bail, Messrs. Sullivan and Sumner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he came in sight, which was not for full ten minutes after his
      awful summons, he made a low bow to the chancellor and court facing him. I
      saw not his face, as he was directly under me. He moved on slowly, and, I
      think, supported between his two bails, to the opening of his own box;
      there, lower still, he bowed again; and then, advancing to the bar, he
      leant his hands upon it, and dropped on his knees; but a voice in the same
      minute proclaiming he had leave to rise, he stood up almost
      instantaneously, and a third time, profoundly bowed to the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      What an awful moment this for such a man!&mdash;a man fallen from such
      height of power to a situation so humiliating&mdash;from the almost
      unlimited command of so large a part of the eastern World to be cast at
      the feet of his enemies, of the great tribunal of his country, and of the
      nation at large, assembled thus in a body to try and to judge him! Could
      even his prosecutors at that moment look on&mdash;and not shudder at
      least, if they did not blush?
    </p>
    <p>
      The crier, I think it was, made, in a loud and hollow voice, a public
      proclamation, &ldquo;That Warren Hastings, esquire, late governor-general
      of Bengal, was now on his trial for high<span class="pagenum">99</span><a
      name="link99" id="link99"></a> crimes and misdemeanours, with which he was
      charged by the commons of Great Britain; and that all persons whatsoever
      who had aught to allege against him were now to stand forth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A general silence followed, and the chancellor, Lord Thurlow, now made his
      speech. I will give it you to the best of my power from memory; the
      newspapers have printed it far less accurately than I have retained it,
      though I am by no means exact or secure.

    <h2>
      THE LORD CHANCELLOR&rsquo;S SPEECH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Warren Hastings, you are now brought into this court to answer to
      the charge, brought against you by the knights, esquires, burgesses, and
      commons of Great Britain&mdash;charges now standing only as allegations,
      by them to be legally proved, or by you to be disproved. Bring forth your
      answer and defence, with that seriousness, respect, and truth, due to
      accusers so respectable. Time has been allowed you for preparation,
      proportioned to the intricacies in which the transactions are involved,
      and to the remote distances whence your documents may have been searched
      and required. You will be allowed bail, for the better forwarding your
      defence, and-whatever you can require will still be yours, of time,
      witnesses, and all things else you may hold necessary. This is not granted
      you as any indulgence: it is entirely your due: it is the privilege which
      every British subject has a right to claim, and which is due to every one
      who is brought before this high tribunal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech, uttered in a calm, equal, solemn manner, and in a voice
      mellow and penetrating, with eyes keen and black, yet softened into some
      degree of tenderness while fastened full upon the prisoner&mdash;this
      speech, its occasion, its portent, and its object, had an effect upon
      every hearer of producing the most respectful attention, and, out of the
      committee box at least, the strongest emotions in the cause of Mr.
      Hastings. Again Mr. Hastings made the lowest reverence to the court, and,
      leaning over the bar answered, with much agitation, through evident
      efforts to suppress it, &ldquo;My lords&mdash;Impressed&mdash;deeply
      impressed&mdash;I come before your lordships, equally confident in my own
      integrity, and in the justice of the court before which I am to clear it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impressed&rdquo; and &ldquo;deeply impressed,&rdquo; too, was my
      mind, by this short yet comprehensive speech, and all my best wishes<span
      class="pagenum">100</span><a name="link100" id="link100"></a> for his
      clearance and redress rose warmer than ever in my heart.

    <h2>
      THE READING OF THE CHARGES COMMENCED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A general silence again ensued, and then one of the lawyers opened the
      cause. He began by reading from an immense roll of parchment the general
      charges against Mr. Hastings, but he read in so monotonous a chant that
      nothing more could I hear or understand than now and then the name of
      Warren Hastings.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this reading, to which I vainly lent all my attention, Mr.
      Hastings, finding it, I presume, equally impossible to hear a word, began
      to cast his eyes around the house, and having taken a survey of all in
      front and at the sides, he turned about and looked up; pale looked his
      face&mdash;pale, ill, and altered. I was much affected by the sight of
      that dreadful harass which was written on his countenance. Had I looked at
      him without restraint, it could not have been without tears. I felt
      shocked, too, shocked and ashamed, to be seen by him in that place. I had
      wished to be present from an earnest interest in the business, joined to a
      firm confidence in his powers of defence; but his eyes were not those I
      wished to meet in Westminster Hall. I called upon Miss Gomme and Charles
      to assist me in looking another way, and in conversing with me as I turned
      aside, and I kept as much aloof as possible till he had taken his survey,
      and placed himself again in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time, however, he frequently looked round, and I was soon
      without a doubt that he must see me.... In a few minutes more, while this
      reading was still continued, I perceived Sir Joshua Reynolds in the midst
      of the committee. He, at the same moment, saw me also, and not only bowed,
      but smiled and nodded with his usual good-humour and intimacy, making at
      the same time a sign to his ear, by which I understood he had no trumpet;
      whether he had forgotten or lost it I know not.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would rather have answered all this dumb show anywhere else, as my last
      ambition was that of being noticed from such a box. I again entreated aid
      in turning away; but Miss Gomme, who is a friend of Sir Gilbert Elliot,
      one of the managers and an ill-wisher, for his sake, to the opposite
      cause, would only laugh, and ask why I should not be owned by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not, however, like it, but had no choice from my near<span
      class="pagenum">101</span><a name="link101" id="link101"></a> situation;
      and in a few seconds I had again a bow, and a profound one, and again very
      ridiculously I was obliged to inquire of Lady Claremont who my own
      acquaintance might be. Mr. Richard Burke, senior, she answered. He is a
      brother of the great&mdash;great in defiance of all drawbacks&mdash;Edmund
      Burke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another lawyer now arose, and read so exactly in the same manner, that it
      was utterly impossible to discover even whether it was a charge or an
      answer. Such reading as this, you may well suppose, set every body pretty
      much at their ease and but for the interest I took in looking from time to
      time at Mr. Hastings, and watching his countenance, I might as well have
      been away. He seemed composed after the first half-hour, and calm; but he
      looked with a species of indignant contempt towards his accusers, that
      could not, I think, have been worn had his defence been doubtful. Many
      there are who fear for him; for me, I own myself wholly confident in his
      acquittal.

    <h2>
      AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soon after, a voice just by my side, from the green benches, said, &ldquo;Will
      Miss Burney allow me to renew my acquaintance with her?&rdquo; I turned
      about and saw Mr. Crutchley.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Streatham rose to my mind at sight of him. I have never beheld him
      since the Streatham society was abolished. We entered instantly upon the
      subject of that family, a Subject ever to me the most Interesting. He also
      had never seen poor Mrs. Thrale since her return to England; but he joined
      with me very earnestly in agreeing that, since so unhappy a step was now
      past recall, it became the duty, however painful a one, of the daughters,
      to support, not cast off and contemn, one who was now as much their mother
      as when she still bore their own name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;do you stand the fiery trial of
      this Streatham book that is coming upon us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I acknowledged myself very uneasy about it, and he assured me all who had
      ever been at Streatham were in fright and consternation. We talked all
      these matters over more at length, till I was called away by an &ldquo;How
      d&rsquo;ye do, Miss Burney?&rdquo; from the committee box! And then I saw
      young Mr. Burke, who had jumped up on the nearest form to speak to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pleasant enough! I checked my vexation as well as I was able, since the
      least shyness on my part to those with whom<span class="pagenum">102</span><a
      name="link102" id="link102"></a> formerly I had been social must instantly
      have been attributed to Court influence; and therefore, since I could not
      avoid the notice, I did what I could to talk with him as heretofore. He is
      besides so amiable a young man that I could not be sorry to see him again,
      though I regretted it should be Just In that place, and at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we talked together, Mr. Crutchley went back to his more distant
      seat, and the moment I was able to withdraw from young Mr. Burke, Charles,
      who sat behind me, leant down and told me a gentleman had just desired to
      be presented to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; quoth I. &ldquo;Mr. Windham,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really thought he was laughing, and answered accordingly, but he assured
      me he was in earnest, and that Mr. Windham had begged him to make the
      proposition. What could I do? There was no refusing; yet a planned meeting
      with another of the committee, and one deep in the prosecution, and from
      whom one of the hardest charges has come<a href="#linknote-263"
      name="linknoteref-263" id="linknoteref-263"><small>263</small></a>&mdash;could
      anything be less pleasant as I was then situated? The great chamberlain&rsquo;s
      box is the only part of the Hall that has any communication with either
      the committee box or the House of Commons, and it is also the very nearest
      to the prisoner.

    <h2>
      WILLIAM WINDHAM ESQ., M.P.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Windham I had seen twice before-both times at Miss Monckton&rsquo;s;
      and anywhere else I should have been much gratified by his desire of a
      third meeting, as he is one of the most agreeable, spirited, well-bred,
      and brilliant conversers I have ever spoken with. He is a neighbour, too,
      now, of<span class="pagenum">103</span><a name="link103" id="link103"></a>
      Charlotte&rsquo;s. He is member for Norwich, and a man of family and
      fortune, with a very pleasing though not handsome face, a very elegant
      figure, and an air of fashion and vivacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversations I had had with him at Miss Monckton&rsquo;s had been,
      wholly by his own means, extremely spirited and entertaining. I was sorry
      to see him make one of a set that appeared so inveterate against a man I
      believe so injuriously treated; and my concern was founded upon the good
      thoughts I had conceived of him, not merely from his social talents, which
      are yet very uncommon, but from a reason clearer to my remembrance. He
      loved Dr. Johnson,-and Dr. Johnson returned his affection. Their political
      principles and connexions were opposite, but Mr. Windham respected his
      venerable friend too highly to discuss any points that could offend him;
      and showed for him so true a regard, that, during all his late illnesses,
      for the latter part of his life, his carriage and himself were alike at
      his service, to air, visit, or go out, whenever he was disposed to accept
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was this all; one tender proof he gave of warm and generous regard,
      that I can never forget, and that rose instantly to my mind when I heard
      his name, and gave him a welcome in my eyes when they met his face: it is
      this: Dr. Johnson, in his last visit to Lichfield, was taken ill, and
      waited to recover strength for travelling back to town in his usual
      vehicle, a stage-coach&mdash;as soon as this reached the ears of Mr.
      Windham, he set off for Lichfield in his own carriage, to offer to bring
      hint back to town in it, and at his own time.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a young man of fashion, such a trait towards an old, however dignified
      philosopher, must surely be a mark indisputable of an elevated mind and
      character; and still the more strongly it marked a noble way of thinking,
      as it was done in favour of a person in open opposition to his own party,
      and declared prejudices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles soon told me he was it my elbow. He had taken the place Mr.
      Crutchley had just left. The abord was, on my part, very awkward, from the
      distress I felt lest Mr. Hastings should look up, and from a conviction
      that I must not name <span class="pagenum">104</span><a name="link104"
      id="link104"></a> that gentleman, of whom alone I could then think, to a
      person in a committee against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, however, was easy, having no embarrassing thoughts, since the
      conference was of his own seeking. &lsquo;Twas so long since I had seen
      him, that I almost wonder he remembered me. After the first compliments he
      looked around him, and exclaimed &ldquo;What an assembly is this! How
      striking a spectacle! I had not seen half its splendour down there. You
      have it here to great advantage; you lose some of the lords, but you gain
      all the ladies. You have a very good place here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes and I may safely say I make a very impartial use of it for
      since here I have sat, I have never discovered to which side I have been
      listening!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, but told me they were then running through the charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it essential,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;that they should so run
      them through that nobody can understand them? Is that a form of law?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He agreed to the absurdity and then, looking still at the spectacle, which
      indeed is the most splendid I ever saw, arrested his eyes upon the
      chancellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks very well from hence,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;and how well
      he acquits himself on these solemn occasions! With what dignity, what
      loftiness, what high propriety, he comports himself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This praise to the chancellor, who is a known friend to Mr. Hastings,
      though I believe he would be the last to favour him unjustly now he is on
      trial, was a pleasant sound to my ear, and confirmed my original idea of
      the liberal disposition of my new associate. I joined heartily in the
      commendation, and warmly praised his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even a degree of pompousness,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;in such a
      court as this, seems a propriety.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he &ldquo;but his speech had one word that might
      as well have been let alone: &lsquo;mere allegations&rsquo; he called the
      charges; the word &lsquo;mere,&rsquo; at least, might have been spared,
      especially as it is already strongly suspected on which side he leans!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I protested, and with truth, I had not heard the word in his speech; but
      he still affirmed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he was as fair and impartial as
      possible: he called the accusers &lsquo;so respectable!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but &lsquo;mere&mdash;mere&rsquo; was no word for this
      occasion and it could not be unguarded, for he would never come to<span
      class="pagenum">105</span><a name="link105" id="link105"></a> speak in
      such a court as this, without some little thinking beforehand. However, he
      is a fine fellow,&mdash;a very fine fellow! and though, in his private
      life, guilty of so many inaccuracies, in his public capacity I really hold
      him to be unexceptionable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This fairness, from an oppositionist professed, brought me at once to easy
      terms with him. I begged him to inform me for what reason, at the end of
      the chancellor&rsquo;s speech, there had been a cry of &ldquo;Hear! hear!
      hear him!&rdquo; which had led me to expect another speech, when I found
      no other seemed intended. He laughed very much, and confessed that, as a
      parliament man, he was so used to that absurdity, that he had ceased to
      regard it; for that it was merely a mark of approbation to a speech
      already spoken; &ldquo;And, in fact, they only,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;say
      &lsquo;Hear!&rsquo; when there is nothing more to be heard!&rdquo; Then,
      still looking at the scene before him, he suddenly laughed, and said,
      &ldquo;I must not, to Miss Burney, make this remark, but-it is observable
      that in the king&rsquo;s box sit the Hawkesbury family, while, next to the
      Speaker, who is here as a sort of representative of the king, sits Major
      Scott!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew his inference, of Court influence in favour of Mr. Hastings, but I
      thought it best to let it pass quietly. I knew, else, I should only be
      supposed under the same influence myself. Looking still on, he next
      noticed the two archbishops. &ldquo;And see,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;the
      Archbishop of York, Markham,&mdash;see how he affects to read the articles
      of impeachment, as if he was still open to either side! My good lord
      archbishop! your grace might, with perfect safety, spare your eyes, for
      your mind has been made up upon this subject before ever it was
      investigated. He holds Hastings to be the greatest man in the world&mdash;for
      Hastings promoted the interest of his son in the East Indies!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      WINDHAM INVEIGHS AGAINST WARREN HASTINGS. Somewhat sarcastic, this&mdash;but
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had as little time as power for answering, since now, and suddenly, his
      eye dropped down upon poor Mr. Hastings; the expression of his face
      instantly lost the gaiety and ease with which it had addressed me; he
      stopped short in his remarks; he fixed his eyes steadfastly on this new,
      and but too interesting object, and after viewing him <span class="pagenum">106</span><a
      name="link106" id="link106"></a> some time in a sort of earnest silence,
      he suddenly exclaimed as if speaking to himself, and from an impulse
      irresistible &ldquo;What a sight is that! to see that man, that small
      portion of human clay, that poor feeble machine of earth, enclosed now in
      that little space, brought to that bar, a prisoner in a spot six foot
      square&mdash;and to reflect on his late power! Nations at his command!
      Princes prostrate at his feet!&mdash;What a change! how Must he feel it!&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and I said not a word. I was glad to see him thus impressed; I
      hoped it might soften his enmity. I found, by his manner, that he had
      never, from the committee box, looked at him. He broke forth again, after
      a pause of Some length,&mdash;&ldquo;Wonderful indeed! almost past
      credibility, is such a reverse! He that, so lately, had the Eastern world
      nearly at his beck; he, under whose tyrant power princes and potentates
      sunk and trembled; he, whose authority was without the reach of
      responsibility!&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he stopped, seeming struck, almost beyond the power of speech, with
      meditative commiseration; but then, suddenly rousing himself, as if
      recollecting his &ldquo;almost blunted purpose,&rdquo; he passionately
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh could those&mdash;the thousands, the millions, who
      have groaned and languished under the iron rod of his oppressions&mdash;could
      they but&mdash;whatever region they inhabit&mdash;be permitted one dawn of
      light to look into this Hall, and see him there! There&mdash;where he now
      stands&mdash;It might prove, perhaps, some recompense for their
      sufferings!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I can hardly tell you, my dearest Susan, how shocked I felt at these
      words! words so hard, and following sensations so much more pitying and
      philosophic! I cannot believe Mr. Hastings guilty; I feel in myself a
      strong internal evidence of his innocence, drawn from all I have seen of
      him; I can only regard the prosecution as a party affair; but yet, since
      his adversaries now openly stake their names, fame, and character against
      him, I did not think it decent to intrude such an opinion. I could only be
      sorry, and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he looked at him, earnest in rumination, and as if unable to turn
      away his eyes; and presently he again exclaimed, &ldquo;How wonderful an
      instance of the instability of mortal power is presented in that object!
      From possessions so extensive, from a despotism so uncontrolled. to see
      him, now there, in that small circumference! In the history Of human
      nature how memorable will be the records of this day!<span class="pagenum">107</span><a
      name="link107" id="link107"></a> a day that brings to the great tribunal
      of the nation a man whose power, so short a time since, was of equal
      magnitude with his crimes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Good heaven! thought I, and do you really believe all this? Can Mr.
      Hastings appear to you such a monster? and are you not merely swayed by
      party? I could not hear him without shuddering, nor see him thus in
      earnest without alarm. I thought myself no longer bound to silence, since
      I saw, by the continuance as well as by the freedom of his exclamations,
      he conceived me of the same sentiments with himself; and therefore I
      hardily resolved to make known to him that mistake, which, indeed, was a
      liberty that seemed no longer impertinent, but a mere act of justice and
      honesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      His very expressive pause, his eyes still steadfastly fixed on Mr.
      Hastings, gave me ample opportunity for speaking&mdash;though I had some
      little difficulty how to get out what I wished to say. However, in the
      midst of his reverie, I broke forth, but not without great hesitation,
      and, very humbly, I said, &ldquo;Could you pardon me, Mr. Windham, If I
      should forget, for a moment, that you are a committee man, and speak to
      you frankly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked surprised, but laughed at the question, and very eagerly called
      out &ldquo;Oh yes, yes, pray speak out, I beg it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, may I venture to say to you that I believe it utterly
      impossible for any one, not particularly engaged on the contrary side,
      ever to enter a court of justice, and not instantly, and involuntarily,
      wish well to the prisoner!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His surprise subsided by this general speech, which I had not courage to
      put in a more pointed way, and he very readily answered, &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis
      natural, certainly, and what must almost unavoidably be the first impulse;
      yet, where justice&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped him; I saw I was not comprehended, and thought else he might say
      something to stop me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;go yet a little farther?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried he, with a very civil smile, &ldquo;and I feel an
      assent beforehand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposing then, that even you, if that may be supposed, could be
      divested of all knowledge of the particulars of this affair, and in the
      same state of general Ignorance that I confess myself to be, and could
      then, like me, have seen Mr. Hastings make his entrance into this court,
      and looked at him when he was brought to that bar; not even you, Mr.
      Windham, could then have reflected on such a vicissitude for him, on all
      he has<span class="pagenum">108</span><a name="link108" id="link108"></a>
      left and all he has lost, and not have given him, like me, all your best
      wishes the moment you beheld him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The promised assent came not, though he was too civil to contradict me;
      but still I saw he Understood me only in a general sense. I feared going
      farther: a weak advocate is apt to be a mischievous one and, as I knew
      nothing, it was not to a professed enemy I could talk of what I only
      believed. Recovering, now, from the strong emotion with which the sight of
      Mr. Hastings had filled him, he looked again around the court, and pointed
      out several of the principal characters present, with arch and striking
      remarks upon each of them, all uttered with high spirit, but none with
      ill-nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pitt,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;is not here!&mdash;a noble stroke
      that for the annals of his administration! A trial is brought on by the
      whole House of Commons in a body, and he is absent at the very opening!
      However,&rdquo; added he, with a very meaning laugh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
      of it, for &rsquo;tis to his eternal disgrace!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mercy! thought I, what a friend to kindness is party!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see Scott?&rdquo; cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I never saw him; pray show him to me,&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is, in green; just now by the Speaker, now moved by the
      committee; in two minutes more he will be somewhere else, skipping
      backwards and forwards; what a grasshopper it is!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot look at him,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;without recollecting a
      very extraordinary letter from him, that I read last summer in the
      newspaper, where he answers some attack that he says has been made upon
      him, because the term is used of &lsquo;a very insignificant fellow,&rsquo;
      and he printed two or three letters in &lsquo;The Public Advertiser,&rsquo;
      in following days, to prove, with great care and pains, that he knew it
      was all meant as an abuse of himself, from those words!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; cried he, laughing, &ldquo;do you say to that
      notion now you see him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That no one,&rdquo; cried I, examining him with my glass, &ldquo;can
      possibly dispute his claim!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What pity that Mr. Hastings should have trusted his cause to so frivolous
      an agent! I believe, and indeed it is the general belief, both of foes and
      friends, that to his officious and injudicious zeal the present
      prosecution is wholly owing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, Mr. Windham pointed out Mr. Francis to me. &lsquo;TIS a singular
      circumstance, that the friend who most loves and the enemy Who most hates
      Mr. Hastings should bear the same<span class="pagenum">109</span><a
      name="link109" id="link109"></a> name!<a href="#linknote-264"
      name="linknoteref-264" id="linknoteref-264"><small>264</small></a> Mr.
      Windham, with all the bias of party, gave me then the highest character of
      this Mr. Francis, whom he called one of the most ill-used of men. Want of
      documents how to answer forced me to be silent, oppositely as I thought.
      But it was a very unpleasant situation to me, as I saw that Mr. Windham
      still conceived me to have no other interest than a common, and probably
      to his mind, a weak compassion for the prisoner&mdash;that prisoner who,
      frequently looking around, saw me, I am certain, and saw with whom I was
      engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject of Mr. Francis again drew him back to Mr. Hastings, but with
      more severity of mind. &ldquo;A prouder heart,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;an
      ambition more profound, were never, I suppose, lodged in any mortal mould
      than in that man! With what a port he entered! did you observe him? his
      air! I saw not his face, but his air his port!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely there,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;he could not be to blame! He
      comes upon his defence; ought he to look as if he gave himself up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no; &rsquo;tis true he must look what vindication to himself he
      can; we must not blame him there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Encouraged by this little concession, I resolved to venture farther, and
      once more said &ldquo;May I again, Mr. Windham, forget that you are a
      committee-man, and say something not fit for a committee man to hear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes!&rdquo; cried he, laughing very much, and looking extremely
      curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must fairly, then, own myself utterly ignorant upon this subject,
      and&mdash;and&mdash;may I go on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you will!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&mdash;and originally prepossessed in favour of the
      object!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He quite started, and with a look of surprise from which all pleasure was
      separated, exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis really true, and really out,
      now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Mr. Hastings, prepossessed!&rdquo; he repeated, in a tone that
      seemed to say&mdash;do you not mean Mr. Burke?<span class="pagenum">110</span><a
      name="link110" id="link110"></a> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for Mr.
      Hastings! But I should not have presumed to own it just at this time,&mdash;so
      little as I am able to do honour to my prepossession by any materials to
      defend it,&mdash;but that you have given me courage, by appearing so free
      from all malignity in the business. Tis, therefore, Your own fault!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can you speak seriously,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;when You say
      you know nothing of this business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very seriously: I never entered into it at all; it was always too
      intricate to tempt me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, surely you must have read the charges?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; they are so long, I had never the courage to begin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conscious look with which he heard this, brought&mdash;all too late&mdash;to
      my remembrance, that one of them was drawn up, and delivered in the House,
      by himself! I was really very sorry to have been so unfortunate; but I had
      no way to call back the words, so was quiet, perforce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come then,&rdquo; cried he, emphatically, &ldquo;to hear Burke!
      come and listen to him, and you will be mistress of the whole. Hear Burke,
      and read the charges of the Begums, and then you will form your judgment
      without difficulty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I would rather (thought I) hear him upon any other subject: but I made no
      answer; I only said, &ldquo;Certainly, I can gain nothing by what is going
      forward to-day. I meant to come to the opening now, but it seems rather
      like the shutting up!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not to be put off. &ldquo;You will come, however, to hear Burke? To
      hear truth, reason, justice, eloquence! You will then see, in other
      colours, &lsquo;That man!&rsquo; There is more cruelty, more oppression,
      more tyranny, in that little machine, with an arrogance, a
      self-confidence, unexampled, unheard of!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY BATTLES FOR THE ACCUSED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir!&rdquo; cried I; &ldquo;that does not appear, to those
      who know him and&mdash;I&mdash;know him a little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; cried he earnestly; &ldquo;personally, do you know
      him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and from that knowledge arose this prepossession I have
      confessed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, what you have seen of him have you then so much approved?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very much! I must own the truth!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have not seen much of him?"<span class="pagenum">111</span><a
      name="link111" id="link111"></a> &ldquo;No, not lately. My first knowledge
      of him was almost immediately upon his coming from India; I had heard
      nothing of all these accusations; I had never been in the way of hearing
      them, and knew not even that there were any to be heard. I saw him,
      therefore, quite without prejudice, for or against him; and indeed, I must
      own, he soon gave me a strong interest in his favour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The surprise with which he heard me must have silenced me on the subject,
      had it not been accompanied with an attention so earnest as to encourage
      me still to proceed. It is evident to me that this committee live so much
      shut Lip with one another, that they conclude all the world of the same
      opinions with themselves, and universally imagine that the tyrant they
      think themselves pursuing is a monster in every part of his life, and held
      in contempt and abhorrence by all mankind. Could I then be sorry, seeing
      this, to contribute my small mite towards clearing, at least, so very wide
      a mistake? On the contrary, when I saw he listened, I was most eager to
      give him all I could to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found him,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;so mild, so gentle, so
      extremely pleasing in his manners&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentle!&rdquo; cried he, with quickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Indeed; gentle even to humility&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humility? Mr. Hastings and humility!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it is true; he is perfectly diffident in the whole of his
      manner, when engaged in conversation; and so much struck was I, at that
      very time, by seeing him so simple, so unassuming, when just returned from
      a government that had accustomed him to a power superior to our monarchs
      here, that it produced an effect upon my mind in his favour which nothing
      can erase!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Yes!&rdquo; cried he, with great energy, &ldquo;you will give
      it up! you must lose it, must give it up! it will be plucked away, rooted
      wholly out of your mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir,&rdquo; cried I, steadily, &ldquo;I believe not!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe not?&rdquo; repeated he, with added animation; &ldquo;then
      there will be the more glory in making you a convert!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; is the word, thought I, I would rather make
      than be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;Mr. Windham,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;all my amazement now
      is at your condescension in speaking to me upon this business at all, when
      I have confessed to you my total ignorance of the subject, and my original
      prepossession in favour of the object. Why<span class="pagenum">112</span><a
      name="link112" id="link112"></a> do you not ask me when I was at the play?
      and how I liked the last opera?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed; and we talked on a little while in that strain, till again,
      suddenly fixing his eyes on poor Mr. Hastings, his gaiety once more
      vanished, and he gravely and severely examined his countenance. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis
      surely,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;an unpleasant one. He does not know, I
      suppose, &rsquo;tis reckoned like his own!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should he,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;look otherwise than
      unpleasant here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;yet still, I think, his features, his
      look, his whole expression, unfavourable to him. I never saw him but once
      before; that was at the bar of the House of Commons and there, as Burke
      admirably said, he looked, when first he glanced an eye against him, like
      a hungry tiger, ready to howl for his prey!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;I am sure he does not look fierce now!
      Contemptuous, a little, I think he does look!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sorry I used this word; yet its truth forced it to escape me. He did
      not like it; he repeated it; he could not but be sure the contempt could
      only be levelled at his prosecutors. I feared discussion, and flew off as
      fast as I could, to softer ground. &ldquo;It was not,&rdquo; cried I,
      &ldquo;with that countenance he gave me my prepossession! Very
      differently, indeed, he looked then!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can he ever look pleasant? can that face ever obtain an
      expression that is pleasing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed and in truth, very pleasant! It was in the country I
      first saw him, and without any restraint on his part; I saw him,
      therefore, perfectly natural and easy. And no one, let me say, could so
      have seen him without being pleased with him&mdash;his quietness and
      serenity, joined to his intelligence and information&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His information?&mdash;in what way?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In such a way as suited his hearer: not upon committee business&mdash;of
      all that I knew nothing. The only conversation in which I could mix was
      upon India, considered simply as, a country in which he had travelled; and
      his communications upon the people, the customs, habits, cities, and
      whatever I could name, were so instructive as well as entertaining, that I
      think I never recollect gaining more intelligence, or more pleasantly
      conveyed, from any conversation in which I ever have been engaged.&rdquo;
      <span class="pagenum">113</span><a name="link113" id="link113"></a> To
      this he listened with an attention that, but for the secret zeal which
      warmed me must have silenced and shamed me. I am satisfied this committee
      have concluded Mr. Hastings a mere man of blood, with slaughter and
      avarice for his sole ideas! The surprise with which he heard this just
      testimony to his social abilities was only silent from good-breeding, but
      his eyes expressed what his tongue withheld; something that satisfied me
      he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had undesignedly been duped by him. I answered this silence by saying
      &ldquo;There was no object for hypocrisy, for it was quite in retirement I
      met with him: it was not lately; it is near two years since I have seen
      him; he had therefore no point to gain with me, nor was there any public
      character, nor any person whatever, that Could induce him to act a part;
      yet was he all I have said-informing, Communicative, instructive, and at
      the same time, gentle and highly pleasing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, very civilly, &ldquo;I begin the less to
      wonder, now, that You have adhered to his side; but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see him, then,&rdquo; cried I, stopping his &lsquo;but,&rsquo;&mdash;&ldquo;to
      see him brought to that bar! and kneeling at it!&mdash;indeed, Mr.
      Windham, I must own to you, I could hardly keep my seat&mdash;hardly
      forbear rising and running out of the Hall.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I agree with you! &lsquo;Tis
      certainly a humiliation not to be wished or defended: it is, indeed, a
      mere ceremony, a mere formality; but it is a mortifying one, and so
      obsolete, so unlike the practices of the times, so repugnant from a
      gentleman to a gentleman, that I myself looked another way: it hurt me,
      and I wished it dispensed with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, Mr. Windham,&rdquo; cried I, surprised and pleased, &ldquo;and
      can you be so liberal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried he, laughing, &ldquo;but &rsquo;tis only to take
      you in!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards he asked what his coat was, whether blue Or purple; and said,
      &ldquo;is it not customary for a prisoner to come black?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether or not,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;I am heartily glad he has
      not done it; why should he seem so dismal, so shut out from hope?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I believe he is in the right. I think he has judged that not
      ill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t be so candid,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;I beg you not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I must; and you know the reason,&rdquo; cried he, gaily;
      but presently exclaimed, &ldquo;one unpleasant thing belong-<span
      class="pagenum">114</span><a name="link114" id="link114"></a> ing to being
      a manager is that I must now go and show myself in the committee.&rdquo;
      And then he very civilly bowed, and went down to his box, leaving me much
      persuaded that I had never yet been engaged in a conversation so curious,
      from its circumstances, in my life. The warm well-wisher myself of the
      prisoner, though formerly the warmest admirer of his accuser, engaged,
      even at his trial and in his presence, in so open a discussion with one of
      his principal prosecutors; and the queen herself in full view, unavoidably
      beholding me in close and eager conference with an avowed member of the
      opposition!
    </p>
    <p>
      These circumstances made me at first enter into discourse with Mr. Windham
      with the utmost reluctance; but though I wished to shun him, I could not,
      when once attacked, decline to converse with him. It would but injure the
      cause of Mr. Hastings to seem to fear hearing the voice of his accusers;
      and it could but be attributed to undue court-influence had I avoided any
      intercourse with an acquaintance so long ago established as a member of
      the opposition.

    <h2>
      A WEARIED M.P.&mdash;MR. CRUTCHLEY REAPPEARS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the midst of the opening of a trial such as this, so important to the
      country as well as to the individual who is tried, what will you say to a
      man&mdash;a member of the House of Commons who kept exclaiming almost
      perpetually, just at my side, &ldquo;What a bore!&mdash;when will it be
      over?&mdash;Must one come any more?&mdash;I had a great mind not to have
      come at all.&mdash;Who&rsquo;s that?&mdash;Lady Hawkesbury and the Copes?&mdash;Yes.&mdash;A
      pretty girl, Kitty.&mdash;Well, when will they have done?&mdash;I wish
      they&rsquo;d call the question&mdash;I should vote it a bore at once!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just such exclamations as these were repeated, without intermission, till
      the gentleman departed: and who should it be that spoke with so much
      legislative wisdom but Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      In about two or three hours&mdash;this reading still lasting&mdash;Mr.
      Crutchley came to me again. He, too, was so wearied, that he was
      departing; but he stayed some time to talk over our constant topic&mdash;my
      poor Mrs. Thrale. How little does he suspect the interest I unceasingly
      take in her&mdash;the avidity with which I seize every opportunity to
      gather the smallest intelligence concerning her!
    </p>
    <p>
      One little trait of Mr. Crutchley, so characteristic of that queerness
      which distinguishes him, I must mention. He said<span class="pagenum">115</span><a
      name="link115" id="link115"></a> he questioned whether he should comme any
      more: I told him I had imagined the attendance of every member to be
      indispensable. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;ten to one if another
      day they are able to make a house!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lords, however, I suppose, must come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless they like it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I hear if they do not attend they have no tickets.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, Miss Primrose and Miss Cowslip must stay away too!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the pleasure to find him entirely for Mr. Hastings, and to hear he
      had constantly voted on his side through every stage of the business. He
      is a very independent man, and a man of real good character, and, with all
      his oddity, of real understanding. We compared notes very amicably upon
      this subject, and both agreed that those who looked for every flaw in the
      conduct of a man in so high and hazardous a station, ought first to have
      weighed his merits and his difficulties.

    <h2>
      MR. WINDHAM DISCUSSES THE IMPEACHMENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A far more interesting conference, however, was now awaiting me. Towards
      the close of the day Mr. Windham very unexpectedly came again from the
      committee-box, and seated himself by my side. I was glad to see by this
      second visit that my frankness had not offended him. He began, too, in so
      open and social a manner, that I was satisfied he forgave it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;very busy since I left you.&mdash;writing&mdash;
      reading&mdash;making documents.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw he was much agitated; the gaiety which seems natural to him was
      flown, and had left in its place the most evident and unquiet emotion. I
      looked a little surprised, and rallying himself, in a few moments he
      inquired if I wished for any refreshment, and proposed fetching me some.
      But, well as I liked him for a conspirator, I could not break bread with
      him!
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought now all was over of communication between us, but I was
      mistaken. He spoke for a minute or two upon the crowd&mdash;early hour of
      coming&mdash;hasty breakfasting and such general nothings; and then, as if
      involuntarily, he returned to the sole subject on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our plan,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;is all changing: we have all been
      busy&mdash;we are coming into a new method. I have been making
      preparations&mdash;I did not intend speaking for a considerable time&mdash;not
      till after the circuit, but now, I may be called upon, I know not how
      soon."<span class="pagenum">116</span><a name="link116" id="link116"></a>
      Then he stopped&mdash;ruminating&mdash;and I let him ruminate without
      interruption for some minutes, when he broke forth with these reflections:
      &ldquo;How strange, how infatuated a frailty has man with respect to the
      future! Be our views, our designs, our anticipations what they may, we are
      never prepared for it!&mdash;It always takes us by surprise&mdash;always
      comes before we look for it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped; but I waited his explanation without speaking, and, after
      pausing thoughtfully for some time, he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This day&mdash;for which we have all been waiting so anxiously, so
      earnestly&mdash;the day for which we have fought, for which we have
      struggled&mdash;a day, indeed, of national glory, in bringing to this
      great tribunal a delinquent from so high an office&mdash;this day, so much
      wished, has seemed to me, to the last moment, so distant, that now&mdash;now
      that it Is actually arrived, it takes me as if I had never thought of it
      before&mdash;it comes upon me all unexpected, and finds me unready!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still I said nothing, for I did not fully comprehend him, till he added,
      &ldquo;I will not be so affected as to say to you that I have made no
      preparation&mdash;that I have not thought a little upon what I have to do;
      yet now that the moment is actually come&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he broke off, but a generous sentiment was bursting from him, and
      would not be withheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has brought me,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;a feeling of which I
      am not yet quite the master! What I have said hitherto, when I have spoken
      in the house, has been urged and stimulated by the idea of pleading for
      the injured and the absent, and that gave me spirit. Nor do I tell you
      (with a half-conscious smile) that the ardour of the prosecution went for
      nothing&mdash;a prosecution in favour of oppressed millions! But now, when
      I am to speak here, the thought of that man, close to my side&mdash;culprit
      as he is&mdash;that man on whom all the odium is to fall&mdash;gives me, I
      own, a sensation that almost disqualifies me beforehand!&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That this day was ever brought about,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;must
      ever remain a noble memorial of courage and perseverance in the Commons.
      Every possible obstacle has been thrown in our way&mdash;every art of
      government has been at work to impede us&mdash;nothing has been left
      untried to obstruct us&mdash;every check and clog of power and influence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by him,&rdquo; cried I, looking at poor Mr. Hastings; &ldquo;he
      has raised no impediments&mdash;he has been wholly careless."<span
      class="pagenum">117</span><a name="link117" id="link117"></a> &ldquo;Come,&rdquo;
      cried he, with energy, &ldquo;come and hear Burke!&mdash;Come but and hear
      him!&mdash;&rsquo;tis an eloquence irresistible!&mdash;a torrent that
      sweeps all before it with the force of a whirlwind! It will Cure You,
      indeed, of your prepossession, but it will give you truth and right in its
      place. What discoveries has he not made!&mdash;what gulfs has he not dived
      into! Come and hear him, and your conflict will end!&rdquo; I could hardly
      stand this, and, to turn it off&rsquo;, asked him if Mr. Hastings was to
      make his own defence?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;he will only speak by counsel. But
      do not regret that, for his own sake, as he is not used to public
      speaking, and has some impediment in his speech besides. He writes
      wonderfully&mdash;there he shines&mdash;and with a facility quite
      astonishing. Have you ever happened to see any of his writings?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: only one short account, which he calls &lsquo;Memoirs relative
      to some India transactions,&rsquo; and that struck me to be extremely
      unequal&mdash;in some places strong and finely expressed, In others
      obscure and scarce intelligible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just the case&mdash;that ambiguity runs through him in
      everything. Burke has found an admirable word for it in the Persian
      tongue, for which we have no translation, but it means an intricacy
      involved so deep as to be nearly unfathomable&mdash;an artificial
      entanglement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I inquired how it was all to end&mdash;whether this reading was to
      continue incessantly, or any speaking was to follow it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not inquired how that is,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but I
      believe you will now soon be released.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will the chancellor speak to adjourn?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell what the form may be, or how we are to be dissolved.
      I think myself there is nothing more difficult than how to tell people
      they may go about their business. I remember, when I was in the militia,
      it was just what I thought the most awkward, when I had done with my men.
      Use gives one the habit; and I found, afterwards, there was a regular mode
      for it: but, at first, I found it very embarrassing how to get rid of
      them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing excites frankness like frankness; and I answered him in return
      with a case of my own. &ldquo;When first I came to my present residence I
      was perpetually,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;upon the point of making a blunder
      with the queen; for when, after she had honoured me with any conversation,
      she used to say &lsquo;Now I won&rsquo;t keep you&mdash;now I will detain
      you no longer.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">118</span><a name="link118"
      id="link118"></a> I was always ready to answer, &lsquo;Ma&rsquo;am, I am
      in no haste, ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t wish to go!&rsquo; for I was not,
      at first, aware that it was only her mode of dismissing people from her
      presence.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      WINDHAM AFFECTS TO COMMISERATE HASTINGS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Again he was going: but glancing his eyes once more down upon Mr.
      Hastings, he almost sighed&mdash;he fetched, at least, a deep breath,
      while he exclaimed with strong emotion, &ldquo;What a place for a man to
      stand in to hear what he has to hear!&mdash;&rsquo;tis almost too much!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not be easy to tell you how touching at such a time was the
      smallest concession from an avowed opponent, and I could not help
      exclaiming again, &ldquo;O, Mr. Windham, you must not be so liberal!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O!&rdquo; cried he, smiling, and recovering himself, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
      all the deeper malice, only to draw you in!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, however, he did not go: he kept gazing upon Mr. Hastings till he
      seemed almost fascinated to the spot; and presently after, growing more
      and more open in his discourse, he began to talk to me of Sir Elijah
      Impey. I presume my dearest friends, little as they hear of politics and
      state business, must yet know that the House of Commons is threatening Sir
      Elijah with an impeachment, to succeed that of Mr. Hastings, and all upon
      East India transactions of the same date.<a href="#linknote-265"
      name="linknoteref-265" id="linknoteref-265"><small>265</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had given me his sentiments upon this subject, which I had heard
      with that sort of quietness that results from total ignorance of the
      matter, joined to total ignorance of the person concerned, he drew a short
      comparison, which, nearly, from him, and at such a moment, drew the tears
      from my eyes&mdash;nearly do I say?&mdash;Indeed more than that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Elijah,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;knows how to go to work, and by
      getting the lawyers to side with him professionally, has set<span
      class="pagenum">119</span><a name="link119" id="link119"></a> about his
      defence in the most artful manner. He is not only wicked, but a very
      pitiful fellow. Let him but escape fine or imprisonment, and he will
      pocket all indignity, and hold himself happy in getting off: but Hastings
      (again looking steadfastly at him)&mdash;Hastings has feeling&mdash;&rsquo;tis
      a proud feeling, an ambitious feeling&mdash;but feeling he has! Hastings&mdash;come
      to him what may&mdash;fine, imprisonment, whatsoever is inflicted&mdash;all
      will be nothing. The moment of his punishment&mdash;I think it, upon my
      honour!&mdash;was the moment that brought him to that bar!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he said &ldquo;I think it, upon my honour,&rdquo; he laid his hand on
      his breast, as if he implied, &ldquo;I acquit him henceforward.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mr. Hastings! One generous enemy he has at least, who pursues him
      with public hate, but without personal malignity! yet sure I feel he can
      deserve neither!
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not spare to express my sense of this liberality from a foe; for,
      indeed, the situation I was in, and the sight of Mr. Hastings, made it
      very affecting to me. He was affected too, himself; but presently, rising,
      he said with great quickness, &ldquo;I must shake all this off; I must
      have done with it&mdash;dismiss it&mdash;forget that he is there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no,&rdquo; cried I, earnestly, &ldquo;do not forget it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I must.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, remember it rather,&rdquo; cried I; &ldquo;I could almost
      (putting up my hands as if praying) do thus and then, like poor Mr.
      Hastings just now to the house, drop down on my knees to you, to call out
      &lsquo;Remember it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Yes,&rdquo; cried he, precipitately, &ldquo;how else shall I
      go on? I must forget that he is there, and that you are here.&rdquo; And
      then he hurried down to his committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it not a most singular scene?
    </p>
    <p>
      I had afterwards to relate great part of this to the queen herself. She
      saw me engaged in such close discourse, and with such apparent interest on
      both sides, with Mr. Windham, that I knew she must else form conjectures
      innumerable. So candid, so liberal is the mind of the queen, that she not
      only heard me with the most favourable attention towards Mr. Windham, but
      was herself touched even to tears by the relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stayed but a short time after this last conference; for nothing more
      was attempted than reading on the charges and answers, in the same useless
      manner. <span class="pagenum">120</span><a name="link120" id="link120"></a>

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY IS AGAIN PRESENT AT HASTINGS&rsquo;S TRIAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The interest of this trial was so much upon my mind, that I have not kept
      even a memorandum of what passed from the 13th of February to the day when
      I went again to Westminster Hall; nor, except renewing the Friday
      Oratorios with Mrs. Ord, do I recollect one circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second time that the queen, who saw my wishes, indulged me with one of
      her tickets, and a permission of absence for the trial, was to hear Mr.
      Burke, for whom my curiosity and my interest stood the highest. One
      ticket, however, would not do; I could not go alone, and the queen had
      bestowed all her other&rsquo; tickets before she discovered that this was
      a day in my particular wishes. She entered into my perplexity with a
      sweetness the most gracious, and when I knew not how to obviate it,
      commanded me to write to the Duchess of Ancaster, and beg permission to be
      put under the wing of her grace, or any of her friends that were going to
      the Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duchess, unluckily, did not go, from indisposition, nor any of her
      family; but she sent me a very obliging letter, and another ticket from
      Sir Peter Burrell, to use for a companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fixed upon James, who, I knew, wished to hear Mr. Burke for once, and we
      went together very comfortably. When the managers, who, as before, made
      the first procession, by entering their box below us, were all arranged,
      one from among them, whom I knew not, came up into the seats of the House
      of Commons by our side, and said, &ldquo;Captain Burney, I am very glad to
      see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, sir?&rdquo; answered James; &ldquo;here I am, come
      to see the fine show.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this the attacker turned short upon his heel, and abruptly walked
      away, descending into the box, which he did not quit any more. I inquired
      who he was; General Burgoyne, James told me. &ldquo;A manager!&rdquo;
      cried I, &ldquo;and one of the chargers! and you treat the business of the
      Hall with such contempt to his face!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James laughed heartily at his own uncourtly address, but I would not
      repent, though he acknowledged he saw the offence his slight and slighting
      speech had given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fearful lest he should proceed in the same style with my friend Mr.
      Windham, I kept as aloof as possible, to avoid his notice, entreating
      James at the same time to have the complaisance to be silent upon this
      subject, should he discover me<span class="pagenum">121</span><a
      name="link121" id="link121"></a> and approach. My own sentiments were as
      opposite to those of the managers as his, and I had not scrupled to avow
      honestly my dissent; but I well knew Mr. Windham might bear, and even
      respect, from a female, the same openness of opposition that might be
      highly offensive to him from a man. But I could obtain no positive
      promise; he would only compromise with my request, and agree not to speak
      unless applied to first. This, however, contented me, as Mr. Windham was
      too far embarked in his undertaking to solicit any opinion upon it from
      accidentally meeting any common acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      From young Burke and his uncle Richard I had bows from the committee box.
      Mr. Windham either saw me not, or was too much engaged in business to
      ascend.

    <h2>
      BURKE&rsquo;.S SPEECH IN SUPPORT OF THE CHARGES. At length the peers&rsquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      procession closed, the prisoner was brought in, and Mr. Burke began his
      speech. It was the second day of his harangue;<a href="#linknote-266"
      name="linknoteref-266" id="linknoteref-266"><small>266</small></a> the
      first I had not been able to attend.
    </p>
    <p>
      All I had heard of his eloquence, and all I had conceived of his great
      abilities, was more than answered by his performance. Nervous, clear, and
      striking was almost all that he uttered: the main business, indeed, of his
      coming forth was frequently neglected, and not seldom wholly lost, but his
      excursions were so fanciful, so entertaining, and so ingenious, that no
      miscellaneous hearer, like myself, could blame them. It is true he was
      unequal, but his inequality produced an effect which, in so long a speech,
      was perhaps preferable to greater consistency since, though it lost
      attention in its falling off, it recovered it with additional energy by
      some ascent unexpected and wonderful. When he narrated, he was easy,
      flowing, and natural; when he declaimed, energetic, warm, and brilliant.
      The sentiments he interspersed were as nobly conceived as they were highly
      coloured; his satire had a poignancy of wit that made it as entertaining
      as it was penetrating; his allusions and quotations, as far as they were
      English and within my reach, were apt and ingenious&mdash;and the wild and
      sudden flights of his fancy, bursting forth from his creative imagination
      in language fluent, forcible, and varied, had a charm for my ear and my
      attention wholly new and perfectly irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were talents such as these exercised in the service of truth,<span
      class="pagenum">122</span><a name="link122" id="link122"></a> unbiased by
      party and prejudice, how could we sufficiently applaud their exalted
      possessor? But though frequently he made me tremble by his strong and
      horrible representations, his own violence recovered me, by stigmatizing
      his assertions with personal ill-will and designing illiberality. Yet, at
      times I confess, with all that I felt, wished, and thought concerning Mr.
      Hastings, the whirlwind of his eloquence nearly drew me into its vortex. I
      give no particulars of the speech, because they will all be printed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The observations and whispers of our keen as well as honest James, during
      the whole, were highly characteristic and entertaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will he come to the point?"-&ldquo;These are mere words!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;This
      is all sheer detraction!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;All this is nothing to the
      purpose!&rdquo; etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, what say you to all this? how have you been
      entertained?&rdquo; cried a voice at my side; and I saw Mr. Crutchley, who
      came round to speak to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entertained?&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;indeed, not at all, it is quite
      too serious and too horrible for entertainment: you ask after my amusement
      as if I were at an opera or a comedy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A comedy?&rdquo; repeated he, contemptuously, &ldquo;no, a farce!
      It is not high enough for a comedy. To hear a man rant such stuff. But you
      should have been here the first day he spoke; this is milk and honey to
      that. He said then, &lsquo;His heart was as black&mdash;as&mdash;black!&rsquo;
      and called him the captain-general of iniquity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; cried I, for he spoke very loud; &ldquo;that
      young man you see down there, who is looking up, is his son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;and what do I care?&rdquo; How I
      knew Mr. Crutchley again, by his ready talent of defiance, and disposition
      to contempt! I was called aside from him by James.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crutchley retired, and Mr. Windham quitted his den, and approached me,
      with a smile of good-humour and satisfaction that made me instantly
      exclaim, &ldquo;No exultation, Mr. Windham, no questions; don&rsquo;t ask
      me what I think of the speech; I can bear no triumph just now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; cried he, very civilly, &ldquo;I will not, I
      promise you, and you may depend upon me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He then spoke to James, regretting with much politeness that he had seen
      so little of him when he was his neighbour in Norfolk, and attributing it
      to the load of India business he had carried into the country to study. I
      believe I have mentioned<span class="pagenum">123</span><a name="link123"
      id="link123"></a> that Felbrig, Mr. Windham&rsquo;s seat, is within a few
      miles of my brother-in-law, Mr. Francis&rsquo;s house at Aylsham.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, however, ere we knew where we were, we began commenting upon
      the speech. It was impossible to refuse applause to its able delivery and
      skilful eloquence; I, too, who so long had been amongst the warmest
      personal admirers of Mr. Burke, could least of all withhold from him the
      mite of common justice. In talking over the speech, therefore, while I
      kept clear of its purpose, I gave to its execution the amplest praise; and
      I secretly grieved that I held back more blame than I had commendation to
      bestow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the good breeding to accept it just as I offered it, without
      claiming more, or endeavouring to entangle me in my approbation. He even
      checked himself, voluntarily, when he was asking me some question of my
      conversion, by stopping short, and saying, &ldquo;But, no, it is not fair
      to press you; I must not do that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;press me too much, with respect
      to my admiration of the ability of the speaker; I never more wished to
      have written short-hand. I must content myself, however, that I have at
      least a long memory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He regretted very much that I had missed the first opening of the speech,
      and gave me some account of it, adding, I might judge what I had lost then
      by what I had heard now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I frankly confessed that the two stories which Mr. Burke had narrated had
      nearly overpowered me; they were pictures of cruelty so terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But General Caillot,&rdquo; cried he, smiling, &ldquo;the hero of
      one of them, you would be tempted to like: he is as mild, as meek, as
      gentle in his manners&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw he was going to say &ldquo;As your Mr. Hastings;&rdquo; but I
      interrupted him hastily, calling out, &ldquo;Hush! hush! Mr. Windham;
      would you wish me in future to take to nothing but lions?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      FURTHER CONVERSATION WITH MR. WINDHAM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We then went into various other particulars of the speech, till Mr.
      Windham observed that Mr. Hastings was looking up, and, after examining
      him some time, said he did not like his countenance. I could have told him
      that he is generally reckoned extremely like himself but after such an
      observation I would not venture, and only said, &ldquo;Indeed, he is
      cruelly altered: it<span class="pagenum">124</span><a name="link124"
      id="link124"></a> was not so he looked when I conceived for him that
      prepossession I have owned to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Altered, is he?&rdquo; cried he, biting his lips and looking
      somewhat shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and who can wonder? Indeed, it is quite affecting to see him
      sit there to hear such things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not see him,&rdquo; cried he, eagerly &ldquo;I did not think
      it right to look at him during the speech, nor from the committeebox; and,
      therefore, I constantly kept my eyes another way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I-had a great inclination to beg he would recommend a little of the same
      decency to some of his colleagues, among whom are three or four that even
      stand on the benches to examine him, during the severest strictures, with
      opera-glasses. Looking at him again now, myself, I could not see his pale
      face and haggard eye without fresh concern, nor forbear to exclaim,
      &ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Windham, this is a dreadful business!&rdquo; He seemed
      a little struck with this exclamation; and, lest it should offend him, I
      hastened to add, in apology, &ldquo;You look so little like a
      bloody-minded prosecutor, that I forget I ought not to say these things to
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried he, laughing, &ldquo;we are only prosecutors there&mdash;(pointing
      to the committee-box), we are at play up here.&rdquo; ...
    </p>
    <p>
      I wished much to know when he was himself to speak, and made sundry
      inquiries relative to the progress of the several harangues, but all
      without being comprehended, till at length I cried, &ldquo;In short, Mr.
      Windham, I want to know when everybody speaks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He started, and cried with precipitancy, &ldquo;Do you mean me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I hope not; I hope you have no wants about my miserable
      speaking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I Only laughed, and we talked for some time of other things; and then,
      suddenly, he burst forth with, &ldquo;But you have really made me a little
      uneasy by what you dropped just now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something like an intention of hearing me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if that depended wholly on myself, I should certainly do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I hope not! I would not have you here on any account. If you
      have formed any expectations, it will give me great concern.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t be uneasy about that; for whatever expectations<span
      class="pagenum">125</span><a name="link125" id="link125"></a> I may have
      formed, I had much rather have them disappointed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! ho!&mdash;you come, then,&rdquo; cried he, pointedly, &ldquo;to
      hear me, by way of soft ground to rest upon, after the hard course you
      will have been run with these higher-spirited speakers?&rdquo;... He
      desired me not to fail to come and hear Fox. My chances, I told him, were
      very uncertain, and Friday was the earliest of them. &ldquo;He speaks on
      Thursday,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;and indeed you should hear him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thursday is my worst chance of all,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;for
      it is the Court-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is there no dispensation?&rdquo; cried he; and then,
      recollecting himself, and looking very archly at Mr. Fox, who was just
      below us, he added, &ldquo;No,&mdash;true&mdash;not for him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for anybody!&rdquo; cried I; &ldquo;on a Court-day my
      attendance is as necessary, and I am dressed out as fine, and almost as
      stiff, as those heralds are here.&rdquo; I then told him what were my
      Windsor days, and begged he would not seize one of them to speak himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; cried he, quite seriously, &ldquo;would I have
      you here!&mdash;stay away, and only let me hope for your good wishes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be quite sincere,&rdquo; cried I, laughing, &ldquo;and own
      to you that stay away I shall not, if I can possibly come; but as to my
      good wishes, I have not, in this case, one to give you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard this with a start that was almost a jump. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, &ldquo;would you lay me under your judgment without your mercy?&mdash;Why
      this is heavier than any penal statute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke this with an energy that made Mr. Fox look up, to see to whom he
      addressed his speech: but before I could answer it, poor James, tired of
      keeping his promised circumspection, advanced his head to join the
      conversation; and so much was I alarmed lest he should burst forth into
      some unguarded expression of his vehement hatred to the cause, which could
      not but have irritated its prosecutors, that the moment I perceived his
      motion and intention, I abruptly took my leave of Mr. Windham, and
      surprised poor James into a necessity of following me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed I was now most eager to depart, from a circumstance that made me
      feel infinitely awkward. Mr. Burke himself was just come forward, to speak
      to a lady a little below me; Mr. Windham had instantly turned towards me,
      with a look of congratulation that seemed rejoicing for me, that the
      orator<span class="pagenum">126</span><a name="link126" id="link126"></a>
      of the day, and of the cause, was approaching, but I retreated
      involuntarily back, and shirked meeting his eyes. He perceived in an
      instant the mistake he was making, and went on with his discourse as if
      Mr. Burke was out of the Hall. In a minute, however, Mr. Burke himself saw
      me, and he bowed with the most marked civility of manner; my courtesy was
      the most ungrateful, distant, and cold; I could not do otherwise; so hurt
      I felt to see him the head of such a cause, so impossible I found it to
      titter one word of admiration for a performance whose nobleness was so
      disgraced by its tenour, and so conscious was I the whole time that at
      such a moment to say nothing must seem almost an affront, that I hardly
      knew which way to look, or what to do with myself.<a href="#linknote-267"
      name="linknoteref-267" id="linknoteref-267"><small>267</small></a> In
      coming downstairs I met Lord Walsingham and Sir Lucas Pepys. &ldquo;Well,
      Miss Burney,&rdquo; cried the first, &ldquo;what say you to a
      governor-general of India now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only this,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;that I do not dwell much upon any
      question till I have heard its answer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Lucas then attacked me too. All the world against poor Mr. Hastings,
      though without yet knowing what his materials may be for clearing away
      these aspersions!

      February.&mdash;Her majesty at this time was a little indisposed, and we
      missed going to Windsor for a fortnight, during which I received visits of
      inquiry from divers of her ladies&mdash;Mrs. Brudenell, bed-chamber woman;
      Miss Brudenell, her daughter, and a maid of honour elect, would but one of
      that class please to marry or die; Miss Tryon and Miss Beauclerk, maids of
      honour, neither of them in a firm way to oblige Miss Brudenell, being
      nothing approaching to death, though far advanced from marriage; and
      various others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brudenell&rsquo;s only present hope is said to be in Miss Fuzilier,<a
      href="#linknote-268" name="linknoteref-268" id="linknoteref-268"><small>268</small></a>
      who is reported, with what foundation I know not,<span class="pagenum">127</span><a
      name="link127" id="link127"></a> to be likely to become Mrs. Fairly. She
      is pretty, learned, and accomplished; yet, from the very little I have
      seen of her, I should not think she had heart enough to satisfy Mr.
      Fairly, in whose character the leading trait is the most acute
      sensibility, However, I have heard he has disclaimed all such intention,
      with high indignation at the report, as equally injurious to the delicacy
      both of Miss Fuzilier and himself, so recently after his loss.

    <h2>
      THE HASTINGS TRIAL AGAIN: MR. FOX IN A RAGE. And now for my third
    </h2>
    <p>
      Westminster Hall, which, by the queen&rsquo;s own indulgent order, was
      with dear Charlott and Sarah. It was also to hear Mr. Fox, and I was very
      glad to let Mr. Windham see a &ldquo;dispensation&rdquo; was attainable,
      though the cause was accidental, since the queen&rsquo;s cold prevented
      the Drawing-room.<a href="#linknote-269" name="linknoteref-269"
      id="linknoteref-269"><small>269</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      We went early, yet did not get very good places. The managers at this time
      were all in great wrath at a decision made the night before by the Lords,
      upon a dispute between them and the counsel for Mr. Hastings, which turned
      entirely in favour of the latter.<a href="#linknote-270"
      name="linknoteref-270" id="linknoteref-270"><small>270</small></a> When
      they entered their committee-box, led on as usual by Mr. Burke, they all
      appeared in the extremest and most angry emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had caballed together some time, Mr. Windham came up among the
      Commons, to bow to some ladies of his acquaintance, and then to speak to
      me; but he was so agitated and so disconcerted, he could name nothing but
      their recent provocation from the Lords. He seemed quite enraged, and
      broke forth with a vehemence I should not much have liked to have excited.
      They had experienced, he said, in the late decision, the Most injurious
      treatment that could be offered them: the Lords had resolved upon saving
      Mr. Hastings, and the chancellor had taken him under the grossest
      protection.<span class="pagenum">128</span><a name="link128" id="link128"></a>
      &ldquo;In short,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the whole business is taken out of
      our hands, and they have all determined to save him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they indeed?&rdquo; cried I, with Involuntary eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered he, perceiving how little I was shocked for
      him, &ldquo;it is now all going your way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not pretend to be sorry, and only inquired if Mr. Fox was to
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; cried he, hastily, &ldquo;what is to be done,
      who will speak, or what will be resolved. Fox is in a rage! Oh, a rage!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yet I hope he will speak. I have never heard him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? not the other day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I was then at Windsor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I remember you told me you were going. You have lost every
      thing by it! To-day will be nothing, he is all rage! On Tuesday he was
      great indeed. You should have heard him then. And Burke, You should have
      heard the conclusion of Burke&rsquo;s speech; &rsquo;twas the noblest ever
      uttered by man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have been told.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day you will hear nothing&mdash;know nothing,&mdash;there will
      be no opportunity,&mdash;Fox is all fury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him he almost frightened me; for he spoke in a tremor himself that
      was really unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried he, looking at me half reproachfully, half
      goodhumouredly, &ldquo;Fox&rsquo;s fury is with the Lords&mdash;not there!&rdquo;
      pointing to Mr. Hastings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw by this he entered into my feelings in the midst of his
      irritability, and that gave me courage to cry out, &ldquo;I am glad of
      that at least!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fox spoke five hours, and with a violence that did not make me forget
      what I had heard of his being in such a fury but I shall never give any
      account of these speeches, as they will all be printed. I shall only say a
      word of the speakers as far as relates to my own feelings about them, and
      that briefly will be to say that I adhere to Mr. Burke, whose oratorical
      powers appear to me far more gentleman-like, scholar-like, and fraught
      with true genius than those of Mr. Fox, it may be I am prejudiced by old
      kindnesses of Mr. Burke, and it may be that the countenance of Mr. Fox may
      have turned me against him, for it struck me to have a boldness in it
      quite hard and callous. However, it is little matter how much my judgment
      in this point may err. With you, my dear friends, I have <span
      class="pagenum">129</span><a name="link129" id="link129"></a> nothing
      further to do than simply to give it; and even should it be wrong, it will
      not very essentially injure you in your politics.

    <h2>
      MRS. CREWE, MR. BURKE, AND MR. WINDHAM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Again, on the fourth time of my attendance at Westminster Hall, honest
      James was my esquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were so late from divers accidents that we did not enter till the same
      moment with the prisoner. In descending the steps I heard my name
      exclaimed with surprise, and looking before me, I saw myself recognised by
      Mrs. Crewe. &ldquo;Miss Burney,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;who could have
      thought of seeing you here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Very obligingly she made me join her immediately, which, as I was with no
      lady, was a very desirable circumstance; and though her political
      principles are well known, and, of course, lead her to side with the
      enemies of Mr. Hastings, she had the good sense to conclude me on the
      other side, and the delicacy never once to distress me by any discussion
      of the prosecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was much disappointed to find nothing intended for this day&rsquo;s
      trial but hearing evidence; no speaker was preparing; all the attention
      was devoted to the witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Adam, Mr. Dudley Long, and others that I know not, Came from the
      committee to chat with Mrs. Crewe; but soon after one came not so unknown
      to me&mdash;Mr. Burke; and Mrs. Crewe, seeing him ascend, named him to me,
      but was herself a little surprised to see it was his purpose to name
      himself, for he immediately made up to me, and with an air of such frank
      kindness that, could I have forgot his errand in that Hall, would have
      made me receive him as formerly, when I was almost fascinated with him.
      But far other were my sensations. I trembled as he approached me, with
      conscious change of sentiments, and with a dread of his pressing from me a
      disapprobation he might resent, but which I knew not how to disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Near-sighted as I am,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I knew you
      immediately. I knew you from our box the moment I looked up; yet how long
      it is, except for an instant here, since I have seen you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I hesitatingly answered, &ldquo;I live in a monastery
      now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing to this. He felt, perhaps, it was meant to express my
      inaccessibility.<span class="pagenum">130</span><a name="link130"
      id="link130"></a> I inquired after Mrs. Burke. He recounted to me the
      particulars of his sudden seizure when he spoke last, from the cramp in
      his stomach, owing to a draught of cold water which he drank in the midst
      of the heat of his oration.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not even wear a semblance of being sorry for him on this occasion;
      and my cold answers made him soon bend down to speak with Mrs. Crewe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was seated in the next row to her, just above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Windham was now talking with her. My whole curiosity and desire being
      to hear him, which had induced me to make a point of coming this time, I
      was eager to know if my chance was wholly gone. &ldquo;You are aware,&rdquo;
      I cried, when he spoke to me, &ldquo;what brings me here this morning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No;&rdquo; he protested he knew not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crewe, again a little surprised, I believe, at this second opposition
      acquaintance, began questioning how often I had attended this trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Windham, with much warmth of regret, told her very seldom, and that I
      had lost Mr. Burke on his best day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then turned to speak to Mr. Burke, that I might not seem listening, for
      they interspersed various civilities upon my peculiar right to have heard
      all the great speeches, but Mr. Burke was in so profound a reverie he did
      not hear me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wished Mr. Windham had not either, for he called upon him aloud, &ldquo;Mr.
      Burke, Miss Burney speaks to you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave me his immediate attention with an air so full of respect that it
      quite shamed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;I had never meant to speak to Mr.
      Burke again after hearing him in Westminster Hall. I had meant to keep at
      least that ‘geographical timidity.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I alluded to an expression in his great speech of &ldquo;geographical
      morality&rdquo; which had struck me very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed heartily, instantly comprehending me, and assured me it was an
      idea that had occurred to him on the moment he had uttered it, wholly
      without study.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little general talk followed; and then, one of the lords rising to
      question some of the evidence, he said he must return to his committee and
      business,-very flatteringly saying, in quitting his post, &ldquo;This is
      the first time I have played truant from the manager&rsquo;s box.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      However I might be obliged to him, which sincerely I felt, I was yet glad
      to have him go. My total ill will to all he was about made his
      conversation merely a pain to me.<span class="pagenum">131</span><a
      name="link131" id="link131"></a> I did not feel the same With regard to
      Mr. Windham. He is not the prosecutor, and seems endowed with so much
      liberality and candour that it not Only encourages me to speak to him what
      I think, but leads me to believe he will one day or other reflect upon
      joining a party so violent as a stain to the independence of his
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost instantly he came forward, to the place Mr. Burke had vacated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you approaching,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;to hear my upbraidings?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; cried he, looking half
      alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I give you warning, if you come you must expect them; so my
      invitation is almost as pleasant as the man&rsquo;s in &lsquo;Measure for
      Measure,&rsquo; who calls to Master Barnardine, &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you
      come down to be hanged?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;have I incurred your upbraidings?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By bringing me here,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;only to disappoint
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I bring you here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by telling me you were to speak to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He protested he could never have made such an assertion. I explained
      myself, reminding him he had told me he was certainly to speak before the
      recess; and that, therefore, when I was informed this was to be the last
      day of trial till after the recess, I concluded I should be right, but
      found myself so utterly wrong as to hear nothing but such evidence as I
      Could not even understand, because it was so uninteresting I could not
      even listen to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strangely,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;are we all moulded, that
      nothing ever in this mortal life, however pleasant in itself, and however
      desirable from its circumstances, can come to us without alloy&mdash;not
      even flattery; for here, at this moment, all the high gratification I
      should feel, and I am well disposed to feel it thoroughly in supposing you
      could think it worth your while to come hither in order to hear me, is
      kept down and subdued by the consciousness how much I must disappoint you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; cried I; &ldquo;the worse you speak, the better
      for my side of the question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, but confessed the agitation of his spirits was so great in the
      thought of that speech, whenever he was to make it, that it haunted him in
      fiery dreams in his sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep!&rdquo; cried I; &ldquo;do you ever sleep?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared a little, but I added with pretended dryness, &ldquo;Do any of
      you that live down there in that prosecutor&rsquo;s den ever sleep in your
      beds? I should have imagined that, had you<span class="pagenum">132</span><a
      name="link132" id="link132"></a> even attempted it, the anticipating ghost
      of Mr. Hastings would have appeared to you in the dead of the night, and
      have drawn your curtains, and glared ghastly in your eyes. I do heartily
      wish Mr. Tickell would send You that ‘Anticipation&rsquo; at once!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea furnished us with sundry images, till, looking down upon Mr.
      Hastings, with an air a little moved, he said, &ldquo;I am afraid the most
      insulting thing we do by him is coming up hither to show ourselves so easy
      and disengaged, and to enter into conversation with the ladies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I hope,&rdquo; cried I, alarmed, &ldquo;he does not see that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why your caps,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;are much in your favour for
      concealment; they are excellent screens to all but the first row!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw him, however, again look at the poor, and, I sincerely believe,
      much-injured prisoner, and as I saw also he still bore With my open
      opposition, I could not but again seize a favourable moment for being more
      serious With him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Mr. Windham,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;I have not forgot what
      dropped from you on the first day of this trial.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked a little surprised. &ldquo;You,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;probably
      have no remembrance of it, for you have been living ever since down there;
      but I was more touched with what you said then, than with all I have since
      heard from all the others, and probably than with all I shall hear even
      from you again when you mount the rostrum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You conclude,&rdquo; cried he, looking very sharp, &ldquo;I shall
      then be better steeled against that fatal candour?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;Mr. Windham, I do really believe
      your steeling to he factitious; notwithstanding you took pains to assure
      me your candour was but the deeper malice; and yet I will own, when once I
      have heard your speech, I have little expectation of ever having the
      honour of conversing with you again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; cried he, starting back &ldquo;what am I to say
      that you denounce such a forfeit beforehand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not explain; I left him to imagine; for, should he prove as
      violent and as personal as the rest, I had no objection to his previously
      understanding I could have no future pleasure in discoursing with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, however,&rdquo; I continued, with a laugh, &ldquo;that
      since I have settled this future taciturnity, I have a fair right in the
      meanwhile to say whatever comes uppermost."<span class="pagenum">133</span><a
      name="link133" id="link133"></a> He agreed to this with great approvance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Molière, you know, in order to obtain a natural opinion of his
      plays, applied to an old woman: you upon the same principle, to obtain a
      natural opinion of political matters, should apply to an ignorant one&mdash;for
      you will never, I am sure, gain it down there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, whether he would or not, but protested this was the severest
      stricture upon his committee that had ever yet been uttered.

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY&rsquo;S UNBIASED SENTIMENTS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I told him as it was the last time he was likely to hear unbiased
      sentiments upon this subject, it was right they should be spoken very
      intelligibly. &ldquo;And permit me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to begin with
      what strikes me the most. Were Mr. Hastings really the culprit he is
      represented, he would never stand there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; cried he, with a candour he could not suppress,
      &ldquo;there seems something favourable in that; it has a Pod look; but
      assure yourself he never expected to see this day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But would he, if guilty, have waited its chance? Was not all the
      world before him? Could he not have chosen any other place of residence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but the shame, the disgrace of a flight?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it all to the shame and disgrace of convicted guilt?&rdquo;
      He made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;shall I tell you, just in the
      same simple style, how I have been struck with the speakers and speeches I
      have yet heard?&rdquo; He eagerly begged me to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole of this public speaking is quite new to me. I was never
      in the House of Commons. It is all a new creation to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what a creation it is,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;how noble,
      how elevating! and what an inhabitant for it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I received his compliment with great courtesy, as an encouragement for me
      to proceed. I then began upon Mr. Burke; but I must give you a very brief
      summary of my speech, as it could only be intelligible at full length from
      your having heard his. I told him that his opening had struck me with the
      highest admiration of his powers, from the eloquence, the imagination, the
      fire, the diversity of expression, and the ready flow of language, with
      which he seemed gifted, in a most superior manner, for any and every
      purpose to which rhetoric<span class="pagenum">134</span><a name="link134"
      id="link134"></a> could lead. &ldquo;And when he came to his two
      narratives,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;whence he related the particulars
      of those dreadful murders, he interested, he engaged, he at last
      overpowered me; I felt my cause lost. I Could hardly keep on my seat. My
      eyes dreaded a single glance towards a man so accused as Mr. Hastings; I
      wanted to sink on the floor, that they might be saved so painful a sight.
      I had no hope he could clear himself; not another wish in his favour
      remained. But When from this narration Mr. Burke proceeded to his own
      comments and declamation&mdash;when the charges of rapacity, cruelty,
      tyranny were general, and made with all the violence of personal
      detestation, and continued and aggravated without any further fact or
      illustration; then there appeared more of study than of truth, more of
      invective than of justice; and, in short, so little of proof to so much of
      passion, that in a very short time I began to lift up my head, my seat was
      no longer uneasy, my eyes were indifferent which way they looked, or what
      object caught them; and before I was myself aware of the declension of Mr.
      Burke&rsquo;s powers over my feelings, I found myself a mere spectator in
      a public place, and looking all around it, with my opera-glass in my hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes sought the ground on hearing this, and with no other comment than
      a rather uncomfortable shrug of the shoulders, he expressively and
      concisely said&mdash;&ldquo;I comprehend you perfectly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a hearing too favourable to stop me; and Mr. Hastings constantly
      before me was an animation to my spirits which nothing less could have
      given me, to a manager of such a committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      I next, therefore, began upon Mr. Fox; and I ran through the general
      matter of his speech, with such observations as had occurred to me in
      hearing it. &ldquo;His violence,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;had that sort of
      monotony that seemed to result from its being factitious, and I felt less
      pardon for that than for any extravagance in Mr. Burke, whose excesses
      seemed at least to be unaffected, and, if they spoke against his judgment,
      spared his probity. Mr. Fox appeared to have no such excuse; he looked all
      good humour and negligent ease the instant before he began a speech of
      uninterrupted passion and vehemence, and he wore the same careless and
      disengaged air the very instant he had finished. A display of talents in
      which the inward man took so little share could have no powers of
      persuasion to those who saw them in that light and therefore.<span
      class="pagenum">135</span><a name="link135" id="link135"></a> however
      their brilliancy might be admired, they were useless to their cause, for
      they left the mind of the hearer in the same state that they found it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short vindication of his friends, he said, &ldquo;You have never
      heard Pitt? You would like him beyond any other competitor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he made his panegyric in very strong terms, allowing him to be
      equal, ready, splendid, wonderful!&mdash;he was in constant astonishment
      himself at his powers and success;&mdash;his youth and inexperience never
      seemed against him: though he mounted to his present height after and in
      opposition to such a vortex of splendid abilities, yet, alone and
      unsupported, he coped with them all! And then, with conscious generosity,
      he finished a most noble éloge with these words: &ldquo;Take&mdash;you may
      take&mdash;the testimony of an enemy&mdash;a very confirmed enemy of Mr.
      Pitt&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not very confirmed, I hope! A man so liberal can harbour no enmity of that
      dreadful malignancy that sets mitigation at defiance for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then asked me if I had heard Mr. Grey? &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered,
      &ldquo;I can come but seldom, and therefore I reserved myself for to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really fill me with compunction,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;But
      if, indeed, I have drawn you into so cruel a waste of your time, the only
      compensation I can make you will be carefully to keep from you the day
      when I shall really speak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I must hear you; for that is all I
      now wait for to make up my final opinion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does it all rest with me?&mdash;&lsquo;Dreadful responsibility&rsquo;&mdash;as
      Mr. Hastings powerfully enough expresses himself in his narrative.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can you allow an expression of Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s to be
      powerful?&mdash;That is not like Mr. Fox, who, in acknowledging some one
      small thing to be right, in his speech, checked himself for the
      acknowledgment by hastily saying &lsquo;Though I am no great admirer of
      the genius and abilities of the gentleman at the bar;&rsquo;&mdash;as if
      he had pronounced a sentence in a parenthesis, between hooks,&mdash;so
      rapidly he flew off to what he could positively censure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And hooks they were indeed he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not inform against me,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;and I will
      give you a little more of Molière&rsquo;s old woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave me his parole, and looked very curious,<span class="pagenum">136</span><a
      name="link136" id="link136"></a> &ldquo;Well then,&mdash;amongst the
      things most striking to an unbiased spectator was that action of the
      orator that led him to look full at the prisoner upon every hard part of
      the charge. There was no courage in it, since the accused is so situated
      he must make no answer; and, not being courage, to Molière&rsquo;s old
      woman it could only seem cruelty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He quite gave up this point without a defence, except telling me it was
      from the habit of the House of Commons, as Fox, who chiefly had done this,
      was a most good-humoured man, and by nothing but habit would have been
      betrayed into such an error.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And another thing,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;which strikes those
      ignorant of senatorial licence, is this,&mdash;that those perpetual
      repetitions, from all the speakers, of inveighing against the power, the
      rapacity, the tyranny, the despotism of the gentleman at the bar, being
      uttered now, when we see him without any power, without even liberty-con
      fined to that spot, and the only person in this large assembly who may not
      leave it when he will&mdash;when we see such a contrast to all we hear we
      think the simplest relation would be sufficient for all purposes of
      justice, as all that goes beyond plain narrative, instead of sharpening
      indignation, only calls to mind the greatness of the fall, and raises
      involuntary commiseration!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you wish,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;to hear me? How you add to my
      difficulties!&mdash;for now, instead of thinking of Lords, Commons,
      bishops, and judges before me, and of the delinquent and his counsel at my
      side, I shall have every thought and faculty swallowed up in thinking of
      who is behind me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This civil speech put an end to Molière&rsquo;s old woman and her
      comments; and not to have him wonder at her unnecessarily, I said, &ldquo;Now,
      then, Mr. Windham, shall I tell you fairly what it is that induced me to
      say all this to you?&mdash;Dr. Johnson!&mdash;what I have heard from him
      of Mr. Windham has been the cause of all this hazardous openness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas a noble cause,&rdquo; cried he, well pleased, &ldquo;and
      noble has been its effect! I loved him, indeed, sincerely. He has left a
      chasm in my heart-a chasm in the world! There was in him what I never saw
      before, what I never shall find again! I lament every moment as lost, that
      I might have spent in his society, and yet gave to any other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How it delighted me to hear this just praise, thus warmly uttered!&mdash;I
      could speak from this moment upon no other subject. I told him how much it
      gratified me; and we agreed<span class="pagenum">137</span><a
      name="link137" id="link137"></a> in comparing notes upon the very few
      opportunities his real remaining friends could now meet with of a similar
      indulgence, since so little was his intrinsic worth understood, while so
      deeply all his foibles had been felt, that in general it was merely a
      matter of pain to hear him even named.
    </p>
    <p>
      How did we then emulate each other in calling to mind all his excellences!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His abilities,&rdquo; cried Mr. Windham, &ldquo;were gigantic, and
      always at hand no matter for the subject, he had information ready for
      everything. He was fertile,&mdash;he was universal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      My praise of him was of a still more solid kind,&mdash;his principles, his
      piety, his kind heart under all its rough coating: but I need not repeat
      what I said,&mdash;my dear friends know every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reminded him of the airings, in which he gave his time with his carriage
      for the benefit of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s health. &ldquo;What an advantage!&rdquo;
      he cried, &ldquo;was all that to myself! I had not merely an admiration,
      but a tenderness for him,&mdash;the more I knew him, the stronger it
      became. We never disagreed; even in politics, I found it rather words than
      things in which we differed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you could so love him,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;knowing him
      only in a general way, what would you have felt for him had you known him
      at Streatham?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I then gave him a little history of his manners and way of life, there,&mdash;his
      good humour, his sport, his kindness, his sociability, and all the many
      excellent qualities that, in the world at large, were by so many means
      obscured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was extremely interested in all I told him, and regrettingly said he
      had only known him in his worst days, when his health was upon its
      decline, and infirmities were crowding fast upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had he lived longer,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I am satisfied I
      should have taken to him almost wholly. I should have taken him to my
      heart! have looked up to him, applied to him, advised with him in all the
      most essential occurrences of my life! I am sure, too,&mdash;though it is
      a proud assertion,&mdash;he would have liked me, also, better, had we
      mingled more. I felt a mixed fondness and reverence growing so strong upon
      me, that I am satisfied the closest union would have followed his longer
      life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I then mentioned how kindly he had taken his visit to him at Lichfield
      during a severe illness, &ldquo;And he left you,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;a
      book?"<span class="pagenum">138</span><a name="link138" id="link138"></a>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and he gave me one, also, just
      before he died. &lsquo;You will look into this Sometimes,&rsquo; he said,
      &lsquo;and not refuse to remember whence you had it.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a
      href="#linknote-271" name="linknoteref-271" id="linknoteref-271"><small>271</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he added he had heard him speak of me,&mdash;and with so much
      kindness, that I was forced not to press a recapitulation: yet now I wish
      I had heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before we broke up, &ldquo;There is nothing,&rdquo; he cried, with
      energy, &ldquo;for which I look back upon myself with severer discipline
      than the time I have thrown away in other pursuits, that might else have
      been devoted to that wonderful man!&rdquo; He then said he must be gone,&mdash;he
      was one in a committee of the House, and could keep away no longer.

    <h2>
      BURKE AND SHERIDAN MEET WITH COLD RECEPTIONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I then again joined in with Mrs. Crewe, who, meantime, had had managers
      without end to converse with her. But, very soon after, Mr. Burke mounted
      to the House of Commons<a href="#linknote-272" name="linknoteref-272"
      id="linknoteref-272"><small>272</small></a> again, and took the place left
      by Mr. Windham. I inquired very much after Mrs. Burke, and we talked of
      the spectacle, and its fine effect; and I ventured to mention, allusively,
      some of the digressive parts of the great speech in which I had heard him:
      but I saw him anxious for speaking more to the point, and as I could not
      talk to him&mdash;the leading prosecutor&mdash;with that frankness of
      opposing sentiments which I used to Mr. Windham, I was anxious only to
      avoid talking at all; and so brief was my speech, and so long my silences,
      that, of course, he was soon wearied into a retreat. Had he not acted such
      a part, with what pleasure should I have exerted myself to lengthen his
      stay!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he went not in wrath: for, before the close, he came yet a third time,
      to say &ldquo;I do not pity you for having to sit there so long, for, with
      you, sitting can now be no punishment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;I may take rest for a twelvemonth back.&rdquo;
      His son also came to speak to me; but, not long after,<span class="pagenum">139</span><a
      name="link139" id="link139"></a> Mrs. Crewe called upon me to say, &ldquo;Miss
      Burney, Mr. Sheridan begs me to introduce him to you, for he thinks you
      have forgot him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not feel very comfortable in this; the part he acts would take from
      me all desire for his notice, even were his talents as singular as they
      are celebrated. Cold, therefore, was my reception of his salutations,
      though as civil as I could make it. He talked a little over our former
      meeting at Mrs. Cholmondeley&rsquo;s, and he reminded me of what he had
      there urged and persuaded with all his might, namely, that I would write a
      comedy; and he now reproached me for my total disregard of his counsel and
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made little or no answer, for I am always put out by such sort of
      discourse, especially when entered upon with such abruptness.
      Recollecting, then, that &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo; had been published since
      that time, he began a very florid flourish, saying he was in my debt
      greatly, not only for reproaches about what I had neglected, but for fine
      speeches about what I had performed. I hastily interrupted him with a fair
      retort, exclaiming,&mdash;&ldquo;O if fine speeches may now be made, I
      ought to begin first&mdash;but know not where I should end!&rdquo; I then
      asked after Mrs. Sheridan, and he soon after left me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crewe was very obligingly solicitous our renewed acquaintance should
      not drop here; she asked me to name any day for dining with her, or to
      send to her at any time when I could arrange a visit: but I was obliged to
      decline it, on the general score of wanting time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the conclusion of the day&rsquo;s business there was much speaking, and
      I heard Mr. Fox, Mr. Burke, and several others; but the whole turned
      extremely in favour of the gentleman at the bar, to the great
      consternation of the accusers, whose own witnesses gave testimony, most
      unexpectedly, on the side of Mr. Hastings.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came away very late; my dear James quite delighted with this happy
      catastrophe.

    <h2>
      AT WINDSOR AGAIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      March.-In our first journey to Windsor this month Mrs. Schwellenberg was
      still unable to go, and the party was Miss Planta, Colonel Wellbred, Mr.
      Fairly, Sir Joseph Banks, and Mr. Turbulent.<span class="pagenum">140</span><a
      name="link140" id="link140"></a> Sir Joseph was so exceedingly shy that we
      made no sort of acquaintance. If instead of going round the world he had
      only fallen from the moon, he could not appear less versed in the usual
      modes of a tea-drinking party. But what, you will say, has a tea-drinking
      party to do with a botanist, a man of science, a president of the Royal
      Society?
    </p>
    <p>
      I left him, however, to the charge of Mr. Turbulent, the two colonels
      becoming, as usual, my joint supporters. And Mr. Turbulent, in revenge,
      ceased not one moment to watch Colonel Wellbred, nor permitted him to say
      a word, or to hear an answer, without some most provoking grimace.
      Fortunately, upon this subject he cannot confuse me; I have not a
      sentiment about Colonel Wellbred, for or against, that shrinks from
      examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-night, however, my conversation was almost wholly with him. I would not
      talk with Mr. Turbulent; I could not talk with Sir Joseph Banks and Mr.
      Fairly did not talk with me: he had his little son with him; he was grave
      and thoughtful, and seemed awake to no other pleasure than discoursing
      with that sweet boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe I have forgotten to mention that Mrs. Gwynn had called upon me
      one morning, in London, and left me a remarkably fine impression of Mr.
      Bunbury&rsquo;s &ldquo;Propagation of a Lie,&rdquo; which I had mentioned
      when she was at Windsor, with regret at having never seen it. This I had
      produced here a month ago, to show to our tea-party, and just as it was in
      the hands of Colonel Wellbred, his majesty entered the room; and, after
      looking at it a little while, with much entertainment, he took it away to
      show it to the queen and princesses. I thought it lost; for Colonel
      Wellbred said he concluded it would be thrown amidst the general hoard of
      curiosities, which, when once seen, are commonly ever after forgotten, yet
      which no one has courage to name and to claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      This evening, however, the colonel was successful, and recovered me my
      print. It is so extremely humorous that I was very glad to receive it, and
      in return I fetched my last sketches, which Mr. William Locke had most
      kindly done for me when here last autumn, and indulged Colonel Wellbred
      with looking at them, charging him at the same time to guard them from a
      similar accident. I meant to show them myself to my royal mistress, who is
      all care, caution, and delicacy, to restore to the right owner whatever
      she receives with a perfect knowledge who the right owner is, <span
      class="pagenum">141</span><a name="link141" id="link141"></a> The second
      volume of the &ldquo;Letters&rdquo; of my reverenced Dr. Johnson was now
      lent me by her majesty; I found in them very frequent mention of our name,
      but nothing to alarm in the reading it.

    <h2>
      DEATH OF MRS. DELANY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      April.-I have scarce a memorandum of this fatal month, in which I was
      bereft of the most revered of friends, and, perhaps, the most perfect of
      women.<a href="#linknote-273" name="linknoteref-273" id="linknoteref-273"><small>273</small></a>
      I am yet scarce able to settle whether to glide silently and resignedly&mdash;as
      far as I can&mdash;past all this melancholy deprivation, or whether to go
      back once more to the ever-remembered, ever-sacred scene that closed the
      earthly pilgrimage of my venerable, my sainted friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe I heard the last words she uttered: I cannot learn that she
      spoke after my reluctant departure. She finished with that cheerful
      resignation, that lively hope, which always broke forth when this last&mdash;awful&mdash;but,
      to her, most happy change seemed approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Miss Port and myself were kneeling by her bedside. She had just given
      me her soft hand; without power to see either of us, she felt and knew us.
      O, never can I cease to cherish the remembrance of the sweet, benign, holy
      voice with which she pronounced a blessing upon us both! We kissed her&mdash;and,
      with a smile all beaming&mdash;I thought it so&mdash;of heaven, she seemed
      then to have taken leave of all earthly solicitudes. Yet then, even then,
      short as was her time on earth, the same soft human sensibility filled her
      for poor human objects. She would not bid us farewell&mdash;would not tell
      us she should speak with us no more&mdash;she only said, as she turned
      gently away from us, &ldquo;And now&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go to sleep!&rdquo;&mdash;But,
      O, in what a voice she said it! I felt what the sleep would be; so did
      poor Miss Port.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor, sweet, unfortunate girl! what deluges of tears did she shed over me!
      I promised her in that solemn moment my eternal regard, and she accepted
      this, my first protestation of any kind made to her, as some solace to her
      sufferings. Sacred shall I hold it!&mdash;sacred to my last hour. I
      believe, indeed, that angelic being had no other wish equally fervent.
    </p>
    <p>
      How full of days and full of honours was her exit! I should blush at the
      affliction of my heart in losing her, could I ever<span class="pagenum">142</span><a
      name="link142" id="link142"></a> believe excellence was given us here to
      love and to revere, yet gladly to relinquish. No, I cannot think it: the
      deprivation may be a chastisement, but not a joy. We may submit to it with
      patience; but we cannot have felt it with warmth where we lose it without
      pain, Outrageously to murmur, or sullenly to refuse consolation&mdash;there,
      indeed, we are rebels against the dispensations of providence&mdash;and
      rebels yet more weak than wicked; for what and whom is it we resist? what
      and who are we for such resistance?
    </p>
    <p>
      She bid me&mdash;how often did she bid me not grieve to lose her! Yet she
      said, in my absence, she knew I must, and sweetly regretted how much I
      must miss her. I teach myself to think of her felicity; and I never dwell
      upon that without faithfully feeling I would not desire her return. But,
      in every other channel in which my thoughts and feelings turn, I miss her
      with so sad a void! She was all that I dearly loved that remained within
      my reach; she was become the bosom repository of all the livelong day&rsquo;s
      transactions, reflections, feelings, and wishes. Her own exalted mind was
      all expanded when we met. I do not think she concealed from me the most
      secret thought of her heart; and while every word that fell from her spoke
      wisdom, piety, and instruction, her manner had an endearment, her spirits
      a native gaiety, and her smile, to those she loved, a tenderness so
      animated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blessed spirit! sweet, fair, and beneficent on earth!&mdash;O, gently
      mayest thou now be at rest in that last home to which fearfully I look
      forward, yet not hopeless; never that&mdash;and sometimes with fullest,
      fairest, sublimest expectations! If to her it be given to plead for those
      she left, I shall not be forgotten in her prayer. Rest to her sweet soul!
      rest and everlasting peace to her gentle spirit!
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw my poor lovely Miss Port twice in every day, when in town, till
      after the last holy rites had been performed. I had no peace away from
      her; I thought myself fulfilling a wish of that sweet departed saint, in
      consigning all the time I had at my own disposal to solacing and advising
      with her beloved niece, who received this little offering with a sweetness
      that once again twined her round my heart....
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mrs. Astley, the worthy humble friend, rather than servant, of the
      most excellent departed, was the person whom, next to the niece, I most
      pitied. She was every way to be lamented: unfit for any other service, but
      unprovided for in this, by the utter and most regretted inability of her
      much<span class="pagenum">143</span><a name="link143" id="link143"></a>
      attached mistress, who frequently told me that leaving poor Astley
      unsettled hung heavy on her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dearest friends know, the success I had in venturing to represent her
      worth and situation to my royal mistress. In the moment when she came to
      my room to announce his majesty&rsquo;s gracious intention to pension Mrs.
      Astley here as housekeeper to the same house, I really could scarce
      withhold myself from falling prostrate at her feet: I never felt such a
      burst of gratitude but where I had no ceremonials to repress it. Joseph,
      too, the faithful footman, I was most anxious to secure in some good
      service&mdash;and I related my wishes for him to General Cary, who
      procured for him a place with his daughter, Lady Amherst.
    </p>
    <p>
      I forget if I have ever read you the sweet words that accompanied to me
      the kind legacies left me by my honoured friend. I believe not. They were
      ordered to be sent me with the portrait of Sacharissa, and two medallions
      of their majesties: they were originally written to accompany the legacy
      to the Bishop of Worcester, Dr. Hurd, as you may perceive by the style,
      but it was desired they might also be copied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take this liberty, that my much esteemed and respected friend may
      sometimes recollect a person who was so sensible of the honour of her
      friendship and who delighted so much in her conversation and works.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Need I&mdash;O, I am sure I need not say with what tender, grateful,
      sorrowing joy I received these sweet pledges of her invaluable regard!
    </p>
    <p>
      To these, by another codicil, was added the choice of one of her mosaic
      flowers. And verbally, on the night but one before she died, she desired I
      might have her fine quarto edition of Shakespeare, sweetly saying she had
      never received so much pleasure from him in any other way as through my
      reading.

    <h2>
      THE HASTINGS TRIAL AND MR. WINDHAM AGAIN. The part of this month in
    </h2>
    <p>
      which my Susanna was in town I kept no journal at all. And I have now
      nothing to add but to copy those memorandums I made of the trial on the
      day I went to Westminster Hall with my two friends,<a href="#linknote-274"
      name="linknoteref-274" id="linknoteref-274"><small>274</small></a>
      previously to<span class="pagenum">144</span><a name="link144" id="link144"></a>
      the deep calamity on which I have dwelt. They told me they could not hear
      what Mr. Windham said; and there is a spirit in his discourse more worth
      their hearing than any other thing I have now to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may remember his coming straight from the managers, in their first
      procession to their box, and beginning at once a most animated attack&mdash;scarcely
      waiting first to say &ldquo;How do!&rdquo;&mdash;before he exclaimed
      &ldquo;I have a great quarrel with you&mdash;I am come now purposely to
      quarrel with you&mdash;you have done me mischief irreparable&mdash;you
      have ruined me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: and not only with what passed here, even setting that aside,
      though there was mischief enough here; but you have quite undone me since!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged him to let me understand how.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;When the trial broke up for the
      recess I went into the country, purposing to give my whole time to study
      and business; but, most unfortunately, I had just sent for a new set of
      &lsquo;Evelina;&rsquo; and intending only to look at it, I was so cruelly
      caught that I could not let it out of my hands, and have been living with
      nothing but the Branghtons ever since.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not but laugh, though on this subject &rsquo;tis always awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no parting with it,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I could
      not shake it off from me a moment!&mdash;see, then, every way, what
      mischief you have done me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran on to this purpose much longer, with great rapidity, and then,
      suddenly, stopping, again said, &ldquo;But I have yet another quarrel with
      you, and one you must answer. How comes it that the moment you have
      attached us to the hero and the heroine&mdash;the instant you have made us
      cling to them so that there is no getting disengaged&mdash;twined,
      twisted, twirled them round our very heart-strings&mdash;how is it that
      then you make them undergo such persecutions? There is really no enduring
      their distresses, their Suspenses, their perplexities. Why are you so
      cruel to all around&mdash;to them and their readers?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I longed to say&mdash;Do you object to a persecution?&mdash;but I know he
      spells it prosecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could make no answer: I never can. Talking over one&rsquo;s own writings
      seems to me always ludicrous, because it cannot be impartially, either by
      author or commentator; one feeling,<span class="pagenum">145</span><a
      name="link145" id="link145"></a> the other fearing, too much for strict
      truth and unaffected candour.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we found the subject quite hopeless as to discussion, he changed it,
      and said &ldquo;I have lately seen some friends of yours, and I assure you
      I gave you an excellent character to them: I told them you were firm,
      fixed, and impenetrable to all conviction.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An excellent character, indeed! He meant to Mr. Francis and Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he talked a little of the business of the day and he told me that Mr.
      Anstruther was to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure of it,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;by his manner when he
      entered the managers&rsquo; box. I shall know when you are to speak, Mr.
      Windham, before I hear you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders a little uncomfortably. I asked him to name to
      me the various managers. He did; adding, &ldquo;Do you not like to sit
      here, where you can look down upon the several combatants before the
      battle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he named Mr. Michael Angelo Taylor, I particularly desired he might
      be pointed out to me, telling him I had long wished to see him, from the
      companion given to him in one of the &ldquo;Probationary Odes,&rdquo;
      where they have coupled him with my dear father, most impertinently and
      unwarrantably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, indeed,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;is a licentiousness in the
      press quite intolerable&mdash;to attack and involve private characters in
      their public lampoons! To Dr. Burney they could have no right; but Mr.
      Michael Angelo Taylor is fair game enough, and likes that or any other way
      whatever of obtaining notice. You know what Johnson said to Boswell of
      preserving fame?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were but two ways,&rdquo; he told him, &ldquo;of preserving;
      one was by sugar, the other by salt. &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;as
      the sweet way, Bozzy, you are but little likely to attain, I would have
      you plunge into vinegar, and get fairly pickled at once.&rsquo; And such
      has been the plan of Mr. Michael Angelo Taylor. With the sweet he had,
      indeed, little chance, so he soused into the other, head over ears.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We then united forces in repeating passages from various of the &ldquo;Probationary
      Odes,&rdquo; and talking over various of the managers, till Mr. Anstruther
      was preparing to speak, and Mr. Windham went to his cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sure you will remember that Mr. Burke came also,<span class="pagenum">146</span><a
      name="link146" id="link146"></a> and the panic with which I saw him,
      doubled by my fear lest he should see that panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the speech was over, and evidence was filling up the day&rsquo;s
      business, Mr. Windham returned. Some time after, but I have forgotten how,
      we were agreeing in thinking suspense, and all obscurity, in expectation
      or in opinion, almost the thing&rsquo;s most trying to bear in this mortal
      life, especially where they lead to some evil construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;on the other hand, there is
      nothing so pleasant as clearing away a disagreeable prejudice; nothing SO
      exhilarating as the dispersion of a black mist, and seeing all that had
      been black and gloomy turn out bright and fair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, Sir,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;is precisely what I expect from
      thence,&rdquo; pointing to the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a look he gave me, yet he laughed irresistibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I have been putting my
      expectations from your speech to a kind of test.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how, for heaven&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I have been reading&mdash;running over, rather&mdash;a set of
      speeches, in which almost the whole House made a part, upon the India
      bill; and in looking over those I saw not one that had not in it something
      positively and pointedly personal, except Mr. Windham&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, that was a mere accident.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was just the accident I expected from Mr. Windham. I do not
      mean that there was invective in all the others, for in some there was
      panegyric&mdash;plenty! but that panegyric was always so directed as to
      convey more of severe censure to one party than of real praise to the
      other. Yours was all to the business, and hence I infer you will deal just
      so by Mr. Hastings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; cried he, looking at me very sharp, &ldquo;you
      only want to praise me down. You know what it is to skate a man down?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to skate a man down is a very favourite diversion among a
      certain race Of wags. It is only to praise, and extol, and stimulate him
      to double and treble exertion and effort, till, in order to show his
      desert of such panegyric, the poor dupe makes so many turnings and
      windings, and describes circle after circle with such hazardous dexterity,
      that, at last, down he drops in the midst of his flourishes, to his own
      eternal disgrace, and their entire content.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">147</span><a name="link147" id="link147"></a>I gave
      myself no vindication from this charge but a laugh; and we returned to
      discuss speeches and speakers, and I expressed again my extreme repugnance
      against all personality in these public harangues, except in simply
      stating facts. &ldquo;What say you, then,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;to Pitt?&rdquo;
      He then repeated a warm and animated praise of his powers and his
      eloquence, but finished with this censure: &ldquo;He takes not,&rdquo;
      cried he, &ldquo;the grand path suited to his post as prime minister, for
      he is personal beyond all men; pointed, sarcastic, cutting; and it is in
      him peculiarly unbecoming. The minister should be always conciliating; the
      attack, the probe, the invective, belong to the assailant.&rdquo; Then he
      instanced Lord North, and said much more on these political matters and
      maxims than I can possibly write, or could at the time do more than hear;
      for, as I told him, I not only am no politician, but have no ambition to
      become one, thinking it by no means a female business.

    <h2>
      &ldquo;THE QUEEN IS SO KIND.&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      When he went to the managers&rsquo; box, Mr. Burke again took his place,
      but he held it a very short time, though he was in high good humour and
      civility. The involuntary coldness that results from internal
      disapprobation must, I am sure, have been seen, so thoroughly was it felt.
      I can only talk on this matter with Mr. Windham, who, knowing my opposite
      principles, expects to hear them, and gives them the fairest play by his
      good humour, candour, and politeness. But there is not one other manager
      with whom I could venture such openness.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Mr. Windham takes it all in good part is certainly amongst the things
      he makes plainest, for again, after Mr. Burke&rsquo;s return to the den,
      he came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am happy,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;to find you have not betrayed
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; I would not for the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite satisfied you have kept my counsel; for Mr. Burke has
      been with me twice, and speaking with a good humour I could not else have
      expected from him. He comes to tell me that he never pities me for sitting
      here, whatever is going forward, as the sitting must be rest; and, indeed,
      it seems as if my coming hither was as much to rest my frame as to
      exercise my mind."<span class="pagenum">148</span><a name="link148"
      id="link148"></a> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very good idea, but I do not like
      to realize it; I do not like to think of you and fatigue together. Is it
      so? Do you really want rest?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I am well aware yours is not a mind to turn complainer but yet I
      fear, and not for your rest only, but your time. How is that; have you it,
      as you Ought, at your own disposal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not quite,&rdquo; cried I, laughing. Good heaven! what a
      question, in a situation like mine!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is a thing I cannot bear to think of&mdash;that you
      should want time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the queen,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;is so kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; interrupted he, &ldquo;and I am very glad of it
      but still, time&mdash;and to you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, after all, in the whole, I have a good deal, though always
      uncertain, for, if sometimes I have not two minutes when I expect two
      hours, at other times I have two hours where I expected only two minutes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that is nothing, if you have them not with certainty. Two hours
      are of no more value than two minutes, if you have them not at undoubted
      command.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I answered, &ldquo;The queen is so kind;&rdquo; determined to sound
      that sentence well and audibly into republican ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;that may be some compensation
      to you, but to us, to all others, what compensation is there for depriving
      you of time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Locke, here,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;always wishes time could
      be bought, because there are so many who have more than they know what to
      do with, that those who have less might be supplied very reasonably.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis an exceeding good idea,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;and I am
      sure, if it could be purchased, it ought to be given to YOU by act of
      parliament, as a public donation and tribute.&rdquo; There was a fine
      flourish!

    <h2>
      PERSONAL RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN WINDHAM AND HASTINGS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A little after, while we were observing Mr. Hastings, Mr. Windham
      exclaimed, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s looking up; I believe he is looking for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned hastily away, fairly saying, &ldquo;I hope not."<span
      class="pagenum">149</span><a name="link149" id="link149"></a> &ldquo;Yes,
      he is; he seems as if he wanted to bow to you.&rdquo; I shrank back.
      &ldquo;No, he looks off; he thinks you in too bad company!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah,
      Mr. Windham,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;you should not be so hardhearted
      towards him, whoever else may; and I could tell you, and I will tell you
      if you please, a very forcible reason.&rdquo; He assented. &ldquo;You must
      know, then, that people there are in this world who scruple not to assert
      that there is a very strong personal resemblance between Mr. Windham and
      Mr. Hastings; nay, in the profile, I see it myself at this moment and
      therefore ought not you to be a little softer than the rest, if merely in
      sympathy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed very heartily; and owned he had heard of the resemblance
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could take him extremely well,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;for your
      uncle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; if he looks like my elder brother, I aspire at no more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; he is more like your uncle; he has just that air; he seems
      just of that time of life. Can you then be so unnatural as to prosecute
      him with this eagerness?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, once again, I ventured to give him a little touch of Molière&rsquo;s
      old woman, lest he should forget that good and honest dame; and I told him
      there was one thing she particularly objected to in all the speeches that
      had yet been made, and hoped his speech would be exempt from.
    </p>
    <p>
      He inquired what that was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, she says she does not like to hear every orator compliment
      another; every fresh speaker say, he leaves to the superior ability of his
      successor the prosecution of the business.&rdquo; &ldquo;O, no,&rdquo;
      cried he, very readily, &ldquo;I detest all that sort of adulation. I hold
      it in the utmost contempt.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;And, indeed, it will be time to avoid it when your turn comes, for
      I have heard it in no less than four speeches already.&rdquo; And then he
      offered his assistance about servants and carriages, and we all came away,
      our different routes; but my Fredy and Susan must remember my meeting with
      Mr. Hastings in coming out, and his calling after me, and saying, with a
      very comic sort of politeness, &ldquo;I must come here to have the
      pleasure of seeing Miss Burney, for I see her nowhere else.&rdquo;

      What a strange incident would have been formed had this rencontre happened
      thus if I had accepted Mr. Windham&rsquo;s offered services! I am most

      id="link150"></a> DEATH OF YOUNG LADY MULGRAVE.
    </p>
    <p>
      May.-On the 17th of this month Miss Port bade her sad reluctant adieu to
      London. I gave what time I could command from Miss Port&rsquo;s departure
      to my excellent and maternal Mrs. Ord, who supported herself with
      unabating fortitude and resignation. But a new calamity affected her much,
      and affected me greatly also, though neither she nor I were more than
      distant spectators in comparison with the nearer mourners; the amiable and
      lovely Lady Mulgrave gave a child to her lord, and died, in the first dawn
      of youthful beauty and sweetness, exactly a year after she became his
      wife. &lsquo;Twas, indeed, a tremendous blow. It was all our wonder that
      Lord Mulgrave kept his senses, as he had not been famed for patience or
      piety; but I believe he was benignly inspired with both, from his deep
      admiration of their excellence in his lovely wife.

    <h2>
      AGAIN AT WINDSOR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I must mention a laughable enough circumstance. Her majesty inquired of me
      if I had ever met with Lady Hawke? &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;and
      Lady Say and Sele too.&rdquo; &ldquo;She has just desired permission to
      send me a novel of her own Writing,&rdquo; answered her majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis not the &lsquo;Mausoleum
      of Julia!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But yes, it proved no less! and this she has now published and sends
      about. You must remember Lady Say and Sele&rsquo;s quotation from it.<a
      href="#linknote-275" name="linknoteref-275" id="linknoteref-275"><small>275</small></a>
      Her majesty was so gracious as to lend it me, for I had some curiosity to
      read it. It is all of a piece: all love, love, love, unmixed and
      unadulterated with any more worldly materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      I read also the second volume of the &ldquo;Paston Letters,&rdquo; and
      found their character the same as in the first, and therefore read them
      with curiosity and entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greater part of the month was spent, alas! at Windsor, with what a
      dreary vacuity of heart and of pleasure I need not say. The only period of
      it in which my spirits could be commanded to revive was during two of the
      excursions in which Mr. Fairly was of the party; and the sight of him,
      calm, mild, nay cheerful, under such superior sorrows&mdash;struck me with
      that sort of edifying admiration that led me, perforce, to the best<span
      class="pagenum">151</span><a name="link151" id="link151"></a> exertion in
      my power for the conquest of my deep depression. If I did this from
      conscience in private, from a sense of obligation to him in public I
      reiterated my efforts, as I received from him all the condoling softness
      and attention he could possibly have bestowed upon me had my affliction
      been equal or even greater than his own.

    <h2>
      ANOTHER MEETING WITH MR. CRUTCHLEY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On one of the Egham race days the queen sent Miss Planta and me on the
      course, in one of the royal coaches, with Lord Templeton and Mr. Charles
      Fairly,<a href="#linknote-276" name="linknoteref-276" id="linknoteref-276"><small>276</small></a>
      for our beaux. Lady Templeton was then at the Lodge, and I had the honour
      of two or three conferences with er during her stay. On the course, we
      were espied by Mr. Crutchley, who instantly devoted himself to my service
      for the morning&mdash;taking care of our places, naming jockeys, horses,
      bets, plates, etc., and talking between times of Streatham and all the
      Streathamites. We were both, I believe, very glad of this discourse. He
      pointed out to me where his house stood, in a fine park, within sight of
      the race-ground, and proposed introducing me to his sister, who was his
      housekeeper, and asking me if, through her invitation, I would come to
      Sunning Hill park. I assured him I lived so completely in a monastery that
      I could make no new acquaintance. He then said he expected soon Susan and
      Sophy Thrale on a visit to his sister, and he presumed I would not refuse
      coming to see them. I truly answered I should rejoice to do it if in my
      power, but that most probably I must content myself with meeting them on
      the Terrace. He promised to bring them there with his sister, though he
      had given up that walk these five years.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will give me indeed great pleasure to see them again.

    <h2>
      MR. TURBULENT&rsquo;S TROUBLESOME PLEASANTRIES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My two young beaux Stayed dinner with us, and I afterwards strolled upon
      the lawn with them till tea-time. I could not go on the Terrace, nor
      persuade them to go on by themselves. We backed as the royal party
      returned home; and when they had all entered the house, Colonel Wellbred,
      who had stood aloof, quitted the train to join our little society. &ldquo;Miss<span
      class="pagenum">152</span><a name="link152" id="link152"></a> Burney,&rdquo;
      he cried, &ldquo;I think I know which horse you betted upon! Cordelia!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the name&rsquo;s sake you think it,&rdquo; I cried; and he
      began some questions and comments upon the races, when suddenly the window
      of the tea-room opened, and the voice of Mr. Turbulent, with a most
      sarcastic tone, called out, &ldquo;I hope Miss Burney and Colonel Wellbred
      are well!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We could neither Of us keep a profound gravity, though really he deserved
      it from us both. I turned from the Colonel, and said I was coming directly
      to the tea-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Wellbred would have detained me to finish Our race discourse, for
      he had shut the window when he had made his speech, but I said it was time
      to go in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; cried he, laughing a little, &ldquo;Mr. Turbulent
      only wants his own tea, and he does not deserve it for this!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In, however, I went, and Colonel Manners took the famous chair the instant
      I was seated. We all began race talk, but Mr. Turbulent, approaching very
      significantly, said, &ldquo;Do you want a chair On the other side, ma&rsquo;am?
      Shall I tell the colonel-to bring one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed cried I, half seriously, lest he should do it....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Wellbred, not knowing what had passed, came to that same other
      side, and renewed his conversation. In the midst of all this Mr. Turbulent
      hastily advanced with a chair, saying, &ldquo;Colonel Wellbred, I cannot
      bear to see you standing so long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I found it impossible not to laugh under My hat, though I really wished to
      bid him stand in a corner for a naughty boy. The colonel, I suppose,
      laughed too, whether he would or not, for I heard no answer. However, he
      took the chair, and finding me wholly unembarrassed by this polissonnerie,
      though not wholly unprovoked by it, he renewed his discourse, and kept his
      seat till the party, very late, broke up; but Colonel Manners, who knew
      not what to make of all this, exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am, you
      cannot keep Mr. Turbulent in much order.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June.-Mrs. Schwellenberg came to Windsor with us after the birthday, for
      the rest of the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Turbulent took a formal leave of me at the same time, as his wife now
      came to settle at Windsor, and he ceased to belong to our party. He only
      comes to the princesses at stated hours, and then returns to his own home.
      He gave me many serious thanks for the time passed with me, spoke in
      flourishing<span class="pagenum">153</span><a name="link153" id="link153"></a>
      terms of its contrast to former times, and vowed no compensation could
      ever be made him for the hours he had thrown away by compulsion on &ldquo;The
      Oyster."<a href="#linknote-277" name="linknoteref-277" id="linknoteref-277"><small>277</small></a>
      His behaviour altogether was very well&mdash;here and there a little
      eccentric, but, in the main, merely good-humoured and high-spirited.

    <h2>
      COLONEL FAIRLY AND SECOND ATTACHMENTS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am persuaded there is no manner of truth in the report relative to Mr.
      Fairly and Miss Fuzilier, for he led me into a long conversation with him
      one evening when the party was large, and all were otherwise engaged, upon
      subjects of this nature, in the course of which he asked me if I thought
      any second attachment could either be as strong or as happy as a first.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was extremely surprised by the question, and quite unprepared how to
      answer it, as I knew not with what feelings or intentions I might war by
      any unwary opinions. I did little, therefore, but evade and listen, though
      he kept up the discourse in a very animated manner, till the party all
      broke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I spoken without any consideration but what was general and genuine, I
      should have told him that my idea was simply this, that where a first
      blessing was withdrawn by providence, not lost by misconduct, it seemed to
      me most consonant to reason, nature, and mortal life, to accept what could
      come second, in this as in all other deprivations. Is it not a species of
      submission to the divine will to make ourselves as happy as we can in what
      is left us to obtain, where bereft of what we had sought? My own conflict
      for content in a life totally adverse to my own inclinations, is all built
      on this principle, and when it succeeds, to this owes its success.
    </p>
    <p>
      I presumed not, however, to talk in this way to Mr. Fairly, for I am
      wholly ignorant in what manner or to what degree his first attachment may
      have rivetted his affections; but by the whole of what passed it seemed to
      me very evident that he was not merely entirely without any engagement,
      but entirely at this time without any plan or scheme of forming any; and
      probably he never may. <span class="pagenum">154</span><a name="link154"

    <h2>
      SECTION 13 (1788.) ROYAL VISIT TO CHELTENHAM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Since her establishment at Court we have not yet found Fanny so content
      with her surroundings as she shows herself in the following section of the
      &ldquo;Diary.&rdquo; The comparative quiet of country life at Cheltenham
      was far more to her taste than the tiresome splendours of Windsor and St.
      James&rsquo;s. She had still, it is true, her official duties to perform:
      it was Court life still, but Court life en déshabille. But her time was
      otherwise more at her own disposal, and, above all things, the absence of
      &ldquo;Cerbera,&rdquo; as she nicknamed the amiable Mrs. Schwellenberg and
      the presence of Colonel Digby, contributed to restore to her harassed mind
      that tranquillity which is so pleasantly apparent in the following pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the frequent society of Colonel Digby Fanny seems to have found an
      enjoyment peculiarly adapted to her reserved and sensitive disposition.
      The colonel was almost equally retiring and sensitive with herself, and
      his natural seriousness was deepened by sorrow for the recent loss of his
      wife. A similarity of tastes, as well as (in some respects) of
      disposition, drew him continually to Fanny&rsquo;s tea-table, and the
      gentleness of his manners, the refined and intellectual character of his
      conversation, so unlike the Court gossip to which she was usually
      condemned to remain a patient listener, caused her more and more to
      welcome his visits and to regret his departure. &ldquo;How unexpected an
      indulgence,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;a luxury, I may say, to me, are
      these evenings now becoming!&rdquo; The colonel reads to her&mdash;poetry,
      love-letters, even sermons, and while she listens to such reading, and
      such a reader, her work goes on with an alacrity that renders it all
      pleasure. The friendship which grew up between them was evidently, at
      least on the part of Fanny, of a more than ordinarily tender description.
      Whether, had circumstances permitted, it might have ripened into a feeling
      yet more tender, must remain a matter of speculation. Circumstances did
      not permit, and in after years both married elsewhere.-ED.] <span

    <h2>
      THE ROYAL PARTY AND THEIR SUITE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      July.&mdash;Early in this month the king&rsquo;s indisposition occasioned
      the plan of his going to Cheltenham, to try the effect of the waters drank
      upon the spot. It was settled that the party should be the smallest that
      was possible, as his majesty was to inhabit the house of Lord Fauconberg,
      vacated for that purpose, which was very small. He resolved upon only
      taking his equerry in waiting and pages, etc. Lord Courtown, his treasurer
      of the household, was already at Cheltenham, and therefore at hand to
      attend. The queen agreed to carry her lady of the bedchamber in waiting,
      with Miss Planta and F. B., and none others but wardrobe-women for herself
      and the princesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairly was here almost all the month previously to our departure. At
      first it was concluded he and Colonel Gwynn, the equerry in waiting, were
      to belong wholly to the same table with Miss Planta and me, and Mr. Fairly
      threatened repeatedly how well we should all know one another, and how
      well he would study and know us all au fond.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before we set out the plan was all changed, for the king determined to
      throw aside all state, and make the two gentlemen dine at his own table.
      &ldquo;We shall have, therefore,&rdquo; said Mr. Fairly, with a very civil
      regret, &ldquo;no tea-meetings at Cheltenham.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, was an opening to me of time and leisure such as I had
      never yet enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, my dearest friends, I open an account which promises at least all the
      charms of novelty, and which, if it fulfils its promise, will make this
      month rather an episode than a continuation of my prosaic performance. So
      now for yesterday, Saturday, July 12.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were all up at five o&rsquo;clock; and the noise and confusion reigning
      through the house, and resounding all around it, from the quantities of
      people stirring, boxes nailing, horses neighing, and dogs barking, was
      tremendous.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must now tell you the party:&mdash;Their majesties; the princesses
      Royal, Augusta, and Elizabeth; Lady Weymouth, Mr. Fairly, Colonel Gwynn,
      Miss Planta, and a person you have sometimes met; pages for king, queen,
      and princesses, ward-<span class="pagenum">156</span><a name="link156"
      id="link156"></a> robe-women for ditto, and footmen for all. A smaller
      party for a royal excursion cannot well be imagined. How we shall all
      manage heaven knows. Miss Planta and myself are allowed no maid; the house
      would not hold one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The royal party set off first, to stop and breakfast at Lord Harcourt&rsquo;s
      at Nuneham. You will easily believe Miss Planta and myself were not much
      discomfited in having orders to proceed straight forward. You know we have
      been at Nuneham!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sandys, the queen&rsquo;s wardrobe-woman, and Miss Macentomb, the
      princesses&rsquo;, accompanied us. At Henley-on-Thames, at an inn
      beautifully situated, we stopped to breakfast, and at Oxford to take a
      sort of half dinner.

    <h2>
      LOYALTY NOT DAMPED BY THE RAIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The crowd gathered together upon the road, waiting for the king and queen
      to pass, was immense, and almost unbroken from Oxford to Cheltenham. Every
      town and village within twenty miles seemed to have been deserted, to
      supply all the pathways with groups of anxious spectators. Yet, though so
      numerous, so quiet were they, and so new to the practices of a hackneyed
      mob, that their curiosity never induced them to venture within some yards
      of the royal carriage, and their satisfaction never broke forth into
      tumult and acclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, I believe they never were aware of the moment in which their
      eagerness met its gratification. Their majesties travelled wholly without
      guards or state; and I am convinced, from the time we advanced beyond
      Oxford, they were taken only for their own attendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the towns through which we passed were filled with people, as closely
      fastened one to another as they appear in the pit of the playhouse. Every
      town seemed all face; and all the way upon the road we rarely proceeded
      five miles without encountering a band of most horrid fiddlers, scraping
      &ldquo;God save the king&rdquo; with all their might, out of tune, out of
      time, and all in the rain; for, most unfortunately, there were continual
      showers falling all the day. This was really a subject for serious regret,
      such numbers of men, women, and children being severely sufferers; yet
      standing it all through with such patient loyalty, that I am persuaded not
      even a hail or thunder storm would have dispersed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The country, for the most part, that we traversed, was <span
      class="pagenum">157</span><a name="link157" id="link157"></a>extremely
      pretty; and, as we advanced nearer to our place Of destination, it became
      quite beautiful.

    <h2>
      ARRIVAL AT FAUCONBERG HALL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When we arrived at Cheltenham, which is almost all one street, extremely
      long, clean and well paved, we had to turn out of the public way about a
      quarter of a mile, to proceed to Fauconberg Hall, which my Lord Fauconberg
      has lent for the king&rsquo;s use during his stay at this place.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, indeed, situated on a most sweet spot, surrounded with lofty hills
      beautifully variegated, and bounded, for the principal object, with the
      hills of Malvern, Which, here barren, and there cultivated, here all
      chalk, and there all verdure, reminded me of How hill, and gave Me an
      immediate sensation of reflected as well as of visual pleasure, from
      giving to my new habitation some resemblance of Norbury park.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had mounted the gradual ascent on which the house stands, the
      crowd all around it was as one head! We stopped within twenty yards of the
      door, uncertain how to proceed. All the royals were at the windows; and to
      pass this multitude&mdash;to wade through it, rather,&mdash;was a most
      disagreeable operation. However, we had no choice: we therefore got out,
      and, leaving the wardrobe-women to find the way to the back-door, Miss
      Planta and I glided on to the front one, where we saw the two gentlemen
      and where, as soon as we got up the steps, we encountered the king. He
      inquired most graciously concerning our journey; and Lady Weymouth came
      down-stairs to summon me to the queen, who was in excellent spirits, and
      said she would show me her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; cried I, as I entered it&mdash;&ldquo;is
      this little room for your majesty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O stay,&rdquo; cried she, laughing, &ldquo;till you see your own
      before you call it ‘little&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after, she sent me upstairs for that purpose; and then, to be sure, I
      began to think less diminutively of that I had just quitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mine, with one window, has just space to crowd in a bed, a chest of
      drawers, and three small chairs. The prospect from the window, is
      extremely pretty, and all IS new and clean. So I doubt not being very
      comfortable, as I am senza Cerbera,<a href="#linknote-278"
      name="linknoteref-278" id="linknoteref-278"><small>278</small></a>&mdash;though
      having no maid is a real evil to<span class="pagenum">158</span><a
      name="link158" id="link158"></a> one so little her own mistress as myself.
      I little wanted the fagging of my own clothes and dressing, to add to my
      daily fatigues.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began a little unpacking and was called to dinner. Columb, happily, is
      allowed me, and he will be very useful, I am sure. Miss alone dined with
      me, and we are to be companions constant at all meals, and tete-a-tete,
      during this sejour. She is friendly and well disposed, and I am perfectly
      content; and the more, as I know she will not take up my leisure
      Unnecessarily, for she finds sauntering in the open air very serviceable
      to her health, and she has determined to make that her chief occupation.
      Here, therefore, whenever I am not in attendance, or at meals, I expect
      the singular comfort of having my time wholly unmolested, and at my own
      disposal.

    <h2>
      THE TEA-TABLE DIFFICULTY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A little parlour, which formerly had belonged to Lord Fauconberg&rsquo;s
      housekeeper, is now called mine, and here Miss Planta and myself are to
      breakfast and dine. But for tea we formed a new plan: as Mr. Fairly had
      himself told me he understood there would be no tea-table at Cheltenham, I
      determined to stand upon no ceremony with Colonel Gwynn, but fairly and at
      once take and appropriate my afternoons to my own inclinations. To
      prevent, therefore, any surprise or alteration, we settled to have our tea
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then a difficulty arose as to where? We had each equally small
      bed-rooms, and no dressing-room; but, at length, we fixed on the passage,
      near a window looking over Malvern hills and much beautiful country.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being arranged, we went mutually on with our unpackings, till we were
      both too thirsty to work longer. Having no maid to send, and no bell to
      ring for my man, I then made out my way downstairs, to give Columb
      directions for our tea equipage.
    </p>
    <p>
      After two or three mistakes, of peering into royal rooms, I at length got
      safe to my little parlour, but still was at a loss where to find Columb;
      and while parading in and out, in hopes of meeting with some assistant, I
      heard my name inquired for from the front door. I looked out, and saw Mrs.
      Tracy, senior bedchamber-woman to the queen. She is at Cheltenham for her
      health, and came to pay her duty in inquiries, and so forth.<span
      class="pagenum">159</span><a name="link159" id="link159"></a> I conducted
      her to my little store-room, for such it looks, from its cupboards and
      short checked window curtains; and we chatted upon the place and the
      expedition, till Columb came to tell me that Mr. Fairly desired to speak
      with me. I waited upon him immediately, in the passage leading to the
      kitchen stairs, for that was my salle d&rsquo;audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was with Lord Courtown; they apologised for disturbing me, but Mr.
      Fairly said he came to solicit leave that they might join my tea-table for
      this night only, as they would give orders to be supplied in their own
      apartments the next day, and not intrude upon me any more, nor break into
      my time and retirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is literally the first instance I have met, for now two whole years,
      of being understood as to my own retiring inclinations; and it is singular
      I should first meet with it from the only person who makes them waver.
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged them to come in, and ordered tea. They are well acquainted with
      Mrs. Tracy, and I was very glad she happened to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Miss Planta, meanwhile, I was forced to leave in the lurch; for I
      could not propose the bed-room passage to my present company, and she was
      undressed and unpacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon the king, searching for his gentlemen, found out my room, and
      entered. He admired It prodigiously, and inquired concerning all our
      accommodations. He then gave Mr. Fairly a commission to answer an address,
      or petition, or some such thing to the master of the ceremonies, and,
      after half an hour&rsquo;s chat, retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Gwynn found us out also, but was eager to find out more company,
      and soon left us to go and look over the books at the rooms, for the list
      of the company here.

    <h2>
      A TETE-A-TETE WITH COLONEL FAIRLY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After tea Mrs. Tracy went, and the king sent for Lord Courtown. Mr. Fairly
      was going too, and I was preparing to return upstairs to my toils; but he
      presently changed his design, and asked leave to stay a little longer, if
      I was at leisure. At leisure I certainly was not but I was most content to
      work double tides for the pleasure of his company, especially where given
      thus voluntarily, and not accepted officially.<span class="pagenum">160</span><a
      name="link160" id="link160"></a> What creatures are we all for liberty and
      freedom! Rebels partout! &ldquo;Soon as the life-blood warms the heart,
      The love of liberty awakes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, my dear friends! I wrote that with a sigh that might have pierced
      through royal walls!
    </p>
    <p>
      From this circumstance we entered into discourse with no little spirit. I
      felt flattered, and he knew he had given me de quoi: so we were both in
      mighty good humour. Our sociability, however, had very soon an
      interruption. The king re-entered; he started back at sight of our
      diminished party, and exclaimed, with a sort of arch surprise, &ldquo;What!
      only You two?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairly laughed a little, and I smiled ditto! But I had rather his
      majesty had made such a comment on any other of his establishment, if make
      it he must; since I am sure Mr. Fairly&rsquo;s aversion to that species of
      raillery is equal to my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king gave some fresh orders about the letter, and instantly went away.
      As soon as he was gone, Mr. Fairly,&mdash;perhaps to show himself superior
      to that little sally,&mdash;asked me whether he might write his letter in
      my room?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; cried I, with all the alacrity of the same
      superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then went in search of a page, for pen and ink, and told me, on
      returning, that the king had just given orders for writing implements for
      himself and Colonel Gwynn to be placed in the dining-parlour, of which
      they were, henceforth, to have the use as soon as the dinner-party had
      separated; and after to-night, therefore, he should intrude himself upon
      me no more. I had half a mind to say I was very sorry for it! I assure you
      I felt so.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pretended to require my assistance in his letter, and consulted and
      read over all that he writ. So I gave my opinion as he went on, though I
      think it really possible he might have done without me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Away then he went with it, to dispatch it by a royal footman; and I
      thought him gone, and was again going myself, when he returned,&mdash;surprising
      me not a little by saying, as he held the door in his hand, &ldquo;Will
      there be any&mdash;impropriety&mdash;in my staying here a little logger?&rdquo;
      I must have said no, if I had thought yes; but it would not have been so
      plump and ready a no! and I should not, with<span class="pagenum">161</span><a
      name="link161" id="link161"></a> quite so courteous a grace, have added
      that his stay could do me nothing but honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      On, therefore, we sat, discoursing on various subjects, till the twilight
      made him rise to take leave. He was in much better spirits than I have yet
      seen him, and I know not when I have spent an hour more socially to my
      taste. Highly cultivated by books, and uncommonly fertile in stores of
      internal resource, he left me nothing to wish, for the time I spent with
      him, but that &ldquo;the Fates, the Sisters Three, and suchlike branches
      of learning,&rdquo; would interfere against the mode of future separation
      planned for the remainder of our expedition. Need I more strongly than
      this mark the very rare pleasure I received from his conversation?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a little did poor Miss Planta marvel what had become of me; and scarce
      less was her marvel when she had heard my adventures. She had told me how
      gladly the gentlemen would seize the opportunity of a new situation, to
      disengage themselves from the joint tea-table, and we had mutually agreed
      to use all means possible for seconding this partition; but I had been too
      well satisfied this night, to make any further efforts about the matter,
      and I therefore inwardly resolved to let the future take care of itself&mdash;certain
      it could not be inimical to me, since either it must give me Mr. Fairly in
      a party, or time for my own disposal in solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pleasant beginning has given a spirit to all my expectations and my
      fatigues in this place; and though it cost me near two hours from my downy
      pillow to recover lost time, I stole them without repining, and arose&mdash;dead
      asleep&mdash;this morning, without a murmur.

    <h2>
      THE KING&rsquo;s GENTLEMEN AND THE QUEEN&rsquo;S LADIES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sunday, July 13&mdash;I was obliged to rise before six o&rsquo;clock, that
      I might play the part of dresser to myself, before I played it to the
      queen; so that did not much recruit the fatigues of yesterday&rsquo;s
      rising and journey! Not a little was I surprised to be told, this morning,
      by her majesty, that the gentlemen were to breakfast with Miss Planta and
      me, every morning, by the king&rsquo;s orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I left the queen, I found them already in my little parlour. Mr.
      Fairly came to the door to meet me, and hand me into the room, telling me
      of the new arrangement of the king, with an air of very civil
      satisfaction. Colonel Gwynn<span class="pagenum">162</span><a
      name="link162" id="link162"></a> appeared precisely as I believe he
      felt,-perfectly indifferent to the matter. Miss Planta joined us, and
      Columb was hurried to get ready, lest the king should summon his esquires
      before they had broken their fast. Mr. Fairly undertook to settle our
      seats, and all the etiquette of the tea-table; and I was very well
      content, for when he had placed me where he conceived I should be most
      commodiously situated, he fixed upon the place next me for himself, and
      desired we might all keep to our posts. It was next agreed, that whoever
      came first to the room should order and make the tea; for I must often be
      detained by my waiting, and the king is so rapid in his meals, that
      whoever attends him must be rapid also, or follow fasting. Mr. Fairly said
      he should already have hastened Columb, had he not apprehended it might be
      too great a liberty; for they had waited near half an hour, and expected a
      call every half minute. I set him perfectly at his ease upon this subject,
      assuring him I should be very little at mine if he had ever the same
      scruple again. He had been in waiting, he said, himself, ever since a
      quarter after five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, at which time he showed
      himself under the king&rsquo;s window, and walked before the house till
      six! I was beginning to express my compassion for this harass, but he
      interrupted me with shrewdly saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, this will save future fatigue, for it will establish me such a
      character for early rising and punctuality, that I may now do as I will:
      ‘tis amazing what privileges a man obtains for taking liberties, when once
      his character is established for taking none.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Miss Planta nor myself could attempt going to church, we had both
      so much actual business to do for ourselves, in unpacking, and fitting up
      our rooms, etc. The rest of the day was all fasting, till the evening, and
      then&mdash;who should enter my little parlour, after all the speechifying
      of only one night, made yesterday, but Mr. Fairly, Colonel Gwynn, and Lord
      Courtown! Whether this, again, is by the king&rsquo;s command, or in
      consequence of the morning arrangement, I know not: but not a word more
      has dropped of &ldquo;no evening tea-table;&rdquo; so, whether we are to
      unite, or to separate, in future, I know not, and, which is far more
      extraordinary, I care not! Nobody but you could imagine what a compliment
      that is, from me! I had made Miss Planta promise, in case such a thing
      should happen, to come down; and she was very ready, and<span
      class="pagenum">163</span><a name="link163" id="link163"></a> we had a
      very cheerful evening. Great difficulties, however, arose about our
      tea-equipage, So few things are brought, or at least are yet arrived, that
      Columb is forced to be summoned every other moment, and I have no bell,
      and dare not, for this short time, beg for one, as my man herds with the
      King&rsquo;s men; besides, I have no disposition to make a fuss here,
      where every body takes up with every thing that they get.
    </p>
    <p>
      In lamenting, however, the incessant trouble I was obliged to give the
      gentlemen, of running after Columb, I told Mr. Fairly my obligation, at
      Windsor, to Colonel Wellbred, for my bell there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; cried he, laughing, &ldquo;I am not surprised;
      Colonel Wellbred is quite the man for a &lsquo;belle!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;that he is indeed, and for a &lsquo;beau&rsquo;
      too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O ho! you think him so, do you?&rdquo; quoth he: to which my prompt
      assent followed.

    <h2>
      ROYALTY CROWDED AT FAUCONBERG HALL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The royal family had all been upon the walks. I have agreed with myself
      not to go thither till they have gone through the news-mongers&rsquo;
      drawing up of them and their troop. I had rather avoid all mention and
      after a few days, I may walk there as if not belonging to them, as I am
      not of place or rank to follow in their train.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let me give you, now, an account of the house and accommodation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the ground-floor there is one large and very pleasant room, which is
      made the dining-parlour. The king and royal family also breakfast in it,
      by themselves, except the lady-in-waiting, Lady Weymouth. They sup there
      also, in the same manner. The gentlemen only dine with them, I find. They
      are to breakfast with us, to drink tea where they will, and to sup&mdash;where
      they can; and I rather fancy, from what I have yet seen, it will be
      commonly with good Duke Humphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small, but very neat dressing-room for his majesty is on the other side
      of the hall, and my little parlour is the third and only other room on the
      ground-floor: so you will not think our monarch, his consort and
      offspring, take up too much of the land called their own!
    </p>
    <p>
      Over this eating-parlour, on the first floor, is the queen&rsquo;s
      drawing-room, in which she is also obliged to dress and to undress <span
      class="pagenum">164</span><a name="link164" id="link164"></a> for she has
      no toilette apartment! Who, after that, can repine at any inconvenience
      here for the household? Here, after breakfast, she sits, with her
      daughters and her lady and Lady Courtown, who, with her lord, is lodged in
      the town of Cheltenham. And here they drink tea, and live till suppertime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the king&rsquo;s dressing-room is his bed-room, and over my
      store-room is the bed-room of the princess-royal. And here ends the first
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second is divided and sub-divided into bed-rooms, which are thus
      occupied:&mdash;Princess Augusta and Princess Elizabeth sleep in two beds,
      in the largest room. Lady Weymouth occupies that next in size. Miss Planta
      and myself have two little rooms, built over the king&rsquo;s bed-room and
      Mrs. Sandys and Miss Macentomb, and Lady Weymouth&rsquo;s maid, have the
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the whole house! Not a man but the king sleeps In it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A house is taken in the town for Mr. Fairly and Colonel Gwynn, and there
      lodge several of the servants, and among them Columb. The pages sleep in
      outhouses. Even the house-maids lodge in the town, a quarter of a mile or
      more from the house!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Courtown, as comptroller of the household, acts here for the king, in
      distributing his royal bounty to the Wells, rooms, library, and elsewhere.
      He has sent around very magnificently.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are surrounded by pleasant meadows, in which I mean to walk a great
      deal. They are so quiet and so safe, I can go quite alone; and when I have
      not a first-rate companion, my second best is&mdash;none at all! But I
      expect, very soon, my poor Miss Port, and I shall have her with me almost
      constantly.

      AT THE WELLS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Monday, July 14-This morning I was again up at five o&rsquo;clock, Miss
      Planta having asked me to accompany her to the wells. The queen herself
      went this morning, at six o&rsquo;clock, with his majesty. It is distant
      about a quarter of a mile from Lord Fauconberg&rsquo;s. I tasted the
      water, for once; I shall spare myself any such future regale, for it is
      not prescribed to me, and I think it very unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      This place and air seem very healthy; but the very early<span
      class="pagenum">165</span><a name="link165" id="link165"></a> hours, and
      no maid! I almost doubt how this will do. The fatigue is very great
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were too soon for the company, except the royals. We met them all, and
      were spoken to most graciously by every one. We all came back to breakfast
      much at the same time, and it was very cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent all the rest of the day in hard fagging, at work and business, and
      attendance; but the evening amply recompensed it all. Lord Courtown, Mr.
      Fairly, Colonel Gwynn, and Miss Planta, came to tea. My Lord and Colonel
      Gwynn retired after it, to go to the rooms; Mr. Fairly said he would wait
      to make his bow to his majesty, and see if there were any commands for
      him.

      CONVERSATION AND FLIRTATION WITH COLONEL FAIRLY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      And then we had another very long conversation, and if I did not write in
      so much haste, my dear friends would like to read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our subject to-night&mdash;his subject, rather&mdash;was, the necessity of
      participation, to every species of happiness. &ldquo;His&rdquo; subject,
      you may easily believe; for to him should I never have dared touch on one
      so near and so tender to him. Fredy, however, could join With him more
      feelingly&mdash;though he kept perfectly clear of all that was personal,
      to which I would not have led for a thousand worlds. He seems born with
      the tenderest social affections; and, though religiously resigned to his
      loss&mdash;which, I have been told, the hopeless sufferings of Lady
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; rendered, at last, even a release to be desired&mdash;he
      thinks life itself, single and unshared, a mere melancholy burthen, and
      the wish to have done with it appears the only wish he indulges. I could
      not perceive this without the deepest commiseration, but I did what was
      possible to conceal it; as it is much more easy, both to the hearer and
      the speaker, to lead the discourse to matters more lively, under an
      appearance of being ignorant of the state of a sad heart, than with a
      betrayed consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      We talked of books, and not a little I astonished him by the discovery I
      was fain to make, of the number of authors I have never yet read.
      Particularly he instanced Akenside, and quoted from him some passages I
      have heard selected by Mr. Locke.<span class="pagenum">166</span><a
      name="link166" id="link166"></a> Then we talked of the country, of
      landscapes, of walking, and then, again, came back the favourite
      proposition,&mdash;participation! That, he said, could make an interest in
      anything,&mdash;everything; and O, how did I agree with him! There is
      sympathy enough, heaven knows, in our opinions on this subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not in what followed. I am neither good nor yet miserable enough to
      join with him in what he added,&mdash;that life, taken all in all, was of
      so little worth and value, it could afford its thinking possessor but one
      steady wish,&mdash;that its duration might be short!
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! thought I, that a man so good should be so unhappy!
    </p>
    <p>
      We then came back again to books, and he asked us if we had read a little
      poem called the &ldquo;Shipwreck&rdquo;?<a href="#linknote-279"
      name="linknoteref-279" id="linknoteref-279"><small>279</small></a> Neither
      of us had even heard of it. He said it was somewhat too long, and somewhat
      too technical, but that it contained many beautiful passages. He had it
      with him, he said, and proposed sending Columb for it, to his house, if we
      should like to read it. We thanked him, and off marched Columb. It is in a
      very small duodecimo volume, and he said he would leave it with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after, Miss Planta said she would stroll round the house for a little
      exercise. When she was gone, he took up the book, and said, &ldquo;Shall I
      read some passages to you?&rdquo; I most gladly assented, and got my work,&mdash;of
      which I have no small store, believe me!&mdash;morning caps, robins, etc.,
      all to prepare from day to day; which, with my three constant and long
      attendances, and other official company ceremonies, is no small matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passages he selected were really beautiful: they were chiefly from an
      episode, of Palemon and Anna, excessively delicate, yet tender in the
      extreme, and most touchingly melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      One line he came to, that he read with an emotion extremely affecting&mdash;
      ‘tis a sweet line&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He felt the chastity of silent woe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped upon it, and sighed so deeply that his sadness quite infected
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he read various characters of the ship&rsquo;s company,<span
      class="pagenum">167</span><a name="link167" id="link167"></a> which are
      given with much energy and discrimination. I could not but admire every
      passage he chose, and I was sensible each of them owed much obligation to
      his reading, which was full of feeling and effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      How unwillingly did I interrupt him, to go upstairs and wait my night&rsquo;s
      summons! But the queen has no bell for me, except to my bed-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastily took the hint, and rose to go. &ldquo;Shall I leave the poem,&rdquo;
      he cried, &ldquo;or take it with me, in case there should be any leisure
      to go on with it to-morrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which you please,&rdquo; cried I, a little stupidly, for I did not,
      at the moment, comprehend his meaning which, however, he immediately
      explained by answering, &ldquo;Let me take it, then;&mdash;let me make a
      little interest in it to myself, by reading it with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he put it in his pocket, and went to his home in the town, and up
      stairs went I to my little cell, not a little internally simpering to see
      a trait so like what so often I have done myself,&mdash;carrying off a
      favourite book, when I have begun it with my Susanna, that we might finish
      it together, without leaving her the temptation to peep beforehand.

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY MEETS AN OLD FRIEND.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tuesday, July 15&mdash;While the royals were upon the walks, Miss Planta
      and I strolled in the meadows, and who should I meet there&mdash;but Mr.
      Seward! This was a great pleasure to me. I had never seen him since the
      first day of my coming to St. Jades&rsquo;s, when he handed me into my
      father&rsquo;s coach, in my sacque and long ruffles. You may think how
      much we had to talk over. He had a gentleman with him, fortunately, who
      was acquainted with Miss Planta&rsquo;s brother, so that we formed two
      parties, without difficulty. All my aim was to inquire about Mrs. Piozzi,&mdash;I
      must, at last, call her by her now real name!&mdash;and of her we
      conversed incessantly. He told me Mr. Baretti&rsquo;s late attack upon
      her, which I heard with great concern.<a href="#linknote-280"
      name="linknoteref-280" id="linknoteref-280"><small>280</small></a> It
      seems he has broken off all intercourse with her, and<span class="pagenum">168</span><a
      name="link168" id="link168"></a> not from his own desire, but by her
      evident wish to drop him. This is very surprising; but many others of her
      former friends, once highest in her favour, make the same complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      We strolled so long, talking over this ever-interesting subject, that the
      royals were returned before us, and we found Mr. Fairly waiting in my
      parlour. The rest soon joined. Mr. Seward had expected to be invited; but
      it is impossible for me to invite any body while at Cheltenham, as there
      is neither exit nor entrance but by passing the king&rsquo;s rooms, and as
      I have no place but this little common parlour in which I can sit, except
      my own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither could I see Mr. Seward anywhere else, as my dear friends will
      easily imagine, when they recollect all that has passed, on the subject of
      my visitors, with her majesty and with Mr. Smelt. He told me he had
      strolled in those meadows every day, to watch if I were of the party.

    </div>
    <h2>
      COLONEL FAIRLY AGAIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairly again out-stayed them all. Lord Courtown generally is summoned
      to the royal party after tea, and Colonel Gwynn goes to the town in quest
      of acquaintance and amusement. Mr. Fairly has not spirit for such
      researches; I question, indeed, if he ever had taste for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Miss Planta, went off for her exercise, he again proposed a little
      reading, which again I thankfully accepted. He took out the little poem,
      and read on the mournful tale of Anna, with a sensibility that gave pathos
      to every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      How unexpected an indulgence&mdash;a luxury, I may say, to me, are these
      evenings now becoming! While I listen to such reading and such a reader,
      all my work goes on with an alacrity that renders it all pleasure to me. I
      have had no regale like this for many and many a grievous long evening!
      never since I left Norbury park,&mdash;never since my dear Fredy there
      read Madame de Sevigny. And how little could I expect, in a royal
      residence, a relief of this sort! Indeed, I much question if there is one
      other person, in the whole establishment, that, in an equal degree, could
      afford it. Miss Planta, though extremely friendly, is almost wholly
      absorbed in the cares of her royal duties, and the solicitude<span
      class="pagenum">169</span><a name="link169" id="link169"></a> of her
      ill-health: she takes little interest in anything else, whether for
      conversation or action. We do together perfectly well, for she is good,
      and sensible, and prudent, and ready for any kind office: but the powers
      of giving pleasure are not widely bestowed: we have no right to repine
      that they are wanting where the character that misses them has intrinsic
      worth but, also, we have no remedy against weariness, where that worth is
      united with nothing attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was forced again, before ten o&rsquo;clock, to interrupt his interesting
      narrative, that I might go to my room. He now said he would leave me the
      book to look over and finish at my leisure, upon one condition, which he
      begged me to observe: this was, that I would read with a pen or pencil In
      my hand, and mark the passages that pleased me most as I went on. I
      readily promised this.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then gave it me, but desired I would keep it to myself, frankly
      acknowledging that he did not wish to have it seen by any other, at least
      not as belonging to him. There was nothing, he said of which he had less
      ambition than a character for bookism and pedantry, and he knew if it was
      spread that he was guilty of carrying a book from one house to another, it
      would be a circumstance sufficient for branding him with these epithets.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not possibly help laughing a little at this caution, but again
      gave him my ready promise.

    <h2>
      A VISIT TO MISS PALMER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wednesday, July 16.&mdash;This morning we had the usual breakfast, and
      just as it was over I received a note from Miss Palmer, saying she was
      uncertain whether or not I was at Cheltenham, by not meeting me on the
      walks or at the play, but wrote to mention that she was with Lady D&rsquo;Oyley,
      and hoped, if I was one of the royal suite, my friends might have some
      chance to see me here, though wholly denied it in town. I sent for answer
      that I would call upon her; and as no objection was made by her majesty, I
      went to Sir John D&rsquo;Oyley&rsquo;s as soon as the royal party rode
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Miss Palmer quite thoroughly enraged. We had never met since I
      left the paternal home, though I am always much indebted to her warm zeal.
      Sir John and Lady D&rsquo;Oyley are a mighty gentle pair. Miss Palmer
      could make them no better present than a little of her vivacity. Miss
      Elizabeth<span class="pagenum">170</span><a name="link170" id="link170"></a>
      Johnson, her cousin, is of their party: She is pretty, soft, and pleasing;
      but, unhappily, as deaf as her uncle, Sir Joshua which, in a young female,
      is a real misfortune. To quiet Miss Palmer as much as I was able, I agreed
      tonight that I would join her on the walks. Accordingly, at the usual time
      I set out with Miss Planta, whom I was to introduce to the D&rsquo;Oyleys.
      Just as we set out we perceived the king and his three gentlemen, for Lord
      Courtown is a constant attendant every evening. We were backing on as well
      as we Could, but his majesty perceived us, and called to ask whither we
      were going. We met Mr. Seward, who joined us.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing to describe in the walks: they are straight, clay, and
      sided by common trees, without any rich foliage, or one beautiful opening.
      The meadows, and all the country around, are far preferable: yet here
      everybody meets. All the D&rsquo;Oyley party came, and Miss Planta slipped
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king and queen walked in the same state as on the Terrace at Windsor,
      followed by the three princesses and their attendants. Everybody stopped
      and stood up as they passed, or as they stopped themselves to speak to any
      of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of these stoppings, Lord Courtown backed a little from the suite to
      talk with us, and he said he saw what benefit I reaped from the waters! I
      told him I Supposed I might be the better for the excursion, according to
      the definition of a water-drinking person by Mr. Walpole, who says people
      go to those places well, and then return cured! Mr. Fairly afterwards also
      joined us a little while, and Miss Palmer said she longed to know him
      more, there was something so fine in his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They invited me much to go home with them to tea, but I was engaged. We
      left the walks soon after the royal family, and they carried me near the
      house in Sir John D&rsquo;Oyley&rsquo;s coach. I walked, however, quietly
      in by myself; and in my little parlour I found Mr. Fairly. The others were
      gone off to the play without tea, and the moment it was over Miss Planta
      hurried to her own stroll.

    <h2>
      &ldquo;ORIGINAL LOVE LETTERS.&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      This whole evening I spent tete-a-tete with Mr. Fairly. There is something
      singular in the perfect trust he seems to have in my discretion, for he
      speaks to me when we are alone with a frankness unequalled and something
      very flattering in the <span class="pagenum">171</span><a name="link171"
      id="link171"></a> apparent relief he seems to find in dedicating what time
      he has to dispose of to my little parlour. In the long conference of this
      evening I found him gifted with the justest way of thinking and the most
      classical taste. I speak that word only as I may presume &lsquo;to judge
      it by English literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have another little book,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here, which I am
      sure you would like, but it has a title so very silly that nobody reads or
      names it: ‘Original Love-Letters;<a href="#linknote-281"
      name="linknoteref-281" id="linknoteref-281"><small>281</small></a>&mdash;from
      which you might expect mere nonsense and romance, though, on the contrary,
      you would find in them nothing but good sense, moral reflections, and
      refined ideas, clothed in the most expressive and elegant language.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How I longed to read a book that had such a character!&mdash;yet,
      laughable and prudish as it may seem to you, I could not bring myself to
      accept the half-offer, or make any other reply than to exclaim against the
      injudiciousness of the title-page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, whatever were our subjects, books, life, or persons, all concluded
      with the same melancholy burthen&mdash;speed to his existence here, and
      welcome to that he is awaiting! I fear he has been unfortunate from his
      first setting out.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      THE FOUNDER OF SUNDAY SCHOOLS CRITICIZED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      July 19.&mdash;-The breakfast missed its best regale, Mr. Fairly was ill,
      and confined to his room all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The royal party went to Lord Bathurst&rsquo;s, at Cirencester, and the
      queen commanded Miss Planta and me to take an airing to Gloucester, and
      amuse ourselves as well as we could. Miss Planta had a previous slight
      acquaintance with Mr. Raikes and to his house, therefore, we drove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Raikes<a href="#linknote-282" name="linknoteref-282"
      id="linknoteref-282"><small>282</small></a> was the original founder of
      the Sunday-school, an institution so admirable, so fraught, I hope, with
      future good and mercy to generations yet unborn, that I saw almost with
      reverence the man who had first suggested it. He lives at<span
      class="pagenum">172</span><a name="link172" id="link172"></a> Gloucester
      with his wife and a large family. They all received us with open arms. I
      was quite amazed, but soon found some of the pages had been with them
      already, and announced our design; and as we followed the pages, perhaps
      they concluded we also were messengers, or avant-courieres, of what else
      might be expected. Mr. Raikes is not a man that, without a previous
      disposition towards approbation, I should greatly have admired. He is
      somewhat too flourishing, somewhat too forward, somewhat too voluble; but
      he is worthy, benevolent, good-natured, and good-hearted, and therefore
      the overflowing of successful spirits and delighted vanity must meet with
      some allowance. His wife is a quiet and unpretending woman: his daughters
      common sort of country misses. They seem to live with great hospitality,
      plenty, and good cheer. They gave us a grand breakfast, and then did the
      honours of their city to us with great patriotism. They carried us to
      their fine old cathedral, where we saw the tomb of poor Edward II., and
      many more ancient. Several of the Saxon princes were buried in the
      original cathedral, and their monuments are preserved. Various of the
      ancient nobility, whose names and families were extinct from the Wars of
      the Roses, have here left their worldly honours and deposited their last
      remains. It was all interesting to see, though I will not detail it, for
      any &ldquo;Gloucester guide&rdquo; would beat me hollow at that work. Next
      they carried us to the jail, to show in how small a space, I suppose,
      human beings can live, as well as die or be dead. This jail is admirably
      constructed for its proper purposes&mdash; confinement and punishment.
      Every culprit is to have a separate cell; every cell is clean, neat, and
      small, looking towards a wide expanse of country, and, far more fitted to
      his speculation, a wide expanse of the heavens. Air, cleanliness, and
      health seem all considered, but no other indulgence. A total seclusion of
      all commerce from accident, and an absolute impossibility of all
      intercourse between themselves, must needs render the captivity secure
      from all temptation to further guilt, and all Stimulus to hardihood in
      past crimes, and makes the solitude become so desperate that it not only
      seems to leave no opening, for any comfort save in repentance, but to make
      that almost unavoidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this they carried us to the Infirmary, where I was yet more pleased,
      for the sick and the destitute awaken an interest far less painful than
      the wicked and contemned. We went<span class="pagenum">173</span><a
      name="link173" id="link173"></a> entirely over the house, and then over
      the city, which has little else to catch notice. The pin manufactory we
      did not see, as they discouraged us by an account of its dirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Raikes is a very principal man in all these benevolent institutions;
      and while I poured forth my satisfaction in them very copiously and
      warmly, he hinted a question whether I could name them to the queen.
      &ldquo;Beyond doubt,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;for these were precisely
      the things which most interested her majesty&rsquo;s humanity.&rdquo; The
      joy with which he heard this was nothing short of rapture.

      ON THE WALKS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sunday, July 20-Colonel Gwynn again brought but a bad account of his
      companion, who was now under the care of the Cheltenham apothecary, Mr.
      Clerke.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had appointed in the evening to go on the walks with Miss Palmer. I
      scarce ever passed so prodigious a crowd as was assembled before the house
      when I went out. The people of the whole county seemed gathered together
      to see their majesties; and so quiet, so decent, so silent, that it was
      only by the eye they could be discovered, though so immense a multitude.
      How unlike a London mob!
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, kindly to gratify their zealous and respectful curiosity, came
      to his window, and seeing me go out, he called me to speak to him, and
      give an account of my intentions. The people, observing this graciousness,
      made way for me on every side, so that I passed through them with as much
      facility as if the meadows had been empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The D&rsquo;Oyleys and Miss Johnson and Miss Palmer made the walking
      party, and Mr. Seward joined us. Mr. Raikes and all his family were come
      from Gloucester to see the royal family on the walks, which were very much
      crowded, but with the same respectful multitude, who never came forward,
      but gazed and admired at the most humble distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Raikes introduced me to the Bishop of Gloucester, Dr. Halifax, and
      afterwards, much more to my satisfaction, to the Dean of Gloucester, Dr.
      Tucker, the famous author of &ldquo;Cui bono."<a href="#linknote-283"
      name="linknoteref-283" id="linknoteref-283"><small>283</small></a> I was
      very glad to see him: he is past eighty, and has a most shrewd and keen
      old face.<span class="pagenum">174</span><a name="link174" id="link174"></a>
      I went afterwards to tea with the D&rsquo;Oyleys and Miss Palmer, and Mr.
      Seward again accompanied us. Miss Palmer brought me home in Sir John&rsquo;s
      carriage, making it drive as near as possible to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just before we quitted the walks I was run after by a quick female
      step:&mdash;&ldquo;Miss Burney, don&rsquo;t you know me? have you forgot
      Spotty?&rdquo;&mdash;and I saw Miss Ogle. She told me she had longed to
      come and see me, but did not know if she might. She is here with her
      mother and two younger sisters. I promised to wait on them. Mrs. Oake was
      daughter to the late Bishop of Winchester, who was a preceptor of the king&rsquo;s:
      I knew, therefore, I might promise with approbation.

    <h2>
      AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Monday, July 21.&mdash;I was very much disappointed this morning to see
      Colonel Gwynn come again alone to breakfast, and to hear from him that his
      poor colleague was still confined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The royal party all went at ten o&rsquo;clock to Tewkesbury. About noon,
      while I was writing a folio letter to my dear father, of our proceedings,
      Mr. Alberts, the queen&rsquo;s page, came into my little parlour, and said
      &ldquo;If you are at leisure, ma&rsquo;am, Mr. Fairly begs leave to ask
      you how you do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was all amazement, for I had concluded his confinement irremediable for
      the present. I was quite happy to receive him; he looked very ill, and his
      face is still violently swelled. He had a handkerchief held to it, and was
      muffled up in a great coat; and indeed he seemed unfit enough for coming
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He apologised for interrupting me. I assured him I should have ample time
      for my letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a letter!&rdquo; cried he, looking at its size, &ldquo;it is
      just such a one as I should like to receive, and not&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read,&rdquo; cried I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&mdash;and not answer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He then sat down, and I saw by his manner he came with design to make a
      sociable visit to me. He was serious almost to sadness, but with a
      gentleness that could not but raise in whomsoever he had addressed an
      implicit sympathy. He led almost immediately to those subjects on which he
      loves to<span class="pagenum">175</span><a name="link175" id="link175"></a>
      dwell&mdash;Death and Immortality, and the assured misery of all stations
      and all seasons in this vain and restless world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ventured not to contradict him with my happier sentiments, lest I should
      awaken some fresh pain. I heard him, therefore, in quiet and meditative
      silence, or made but such general answers as could hazard no allusions.
      Yet, should I ever see him in better spirits, I shall not scruple to
      discuss, in such a way as I can, this point, and to vindicate as well as I
      am able my opposite opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told me he had heard a fifth week was to be now added to this
      excursion, and he confessed a most anxious solicitude to be gone before
      that time. He dropped something, unexplained, yet very striking, of a
      peculiar wish to be away ere some approaching period.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt his meaning, though I had no key to it; I felt that he coveted to
      spend in quiet the anniversary of the day on which he lost his lady. You
      may believe I could say nothing to it; the idea was too tender for
      discussion; nor can I divine whether or not he wishes to open more on this
      subject, or is better pleased by my constant silence to his own allusions.
      I know not, indeed, whether he thinks I even understand them.

    <h2>
      COURTS AND COURT LIFE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We then talked over Cheltenham and our way of life, and then ran into
      discourse upon Courts and Court life in general. I frankly said I liked
      them not, and that, if I had the direction of any young person&rsquo;s
      destination, I would never risk them into such a mode of living; for,
      though Vices may be as well avoided there as anywhere &lsquo;and in this
      Court particularly, there were mischiefs of a smaller kind, extremely
      pernicious to all nobleness of character, to which this Court, with all
      its really bright examples, was as liable as any other,&mdash;the
      mischiefs of jealousy, narrowness, and selfishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not see, he said, when there was a place of settled income and
      appropriated business why it might not be filled both with integrity and
      content in a Court as well as elsewhere. Ambition, the desire of rising,
      those, he said, were the motives that envy which set such little passions
      in motion. One situation, however, there was, he said, which he looked
      upon as truly dangerous, and as almost certain to pervert the fairest
      disposition&mdash;it was one in which he would not place any person for
      whom he had the smallest regard, as he looked upon it to<span
      class="pagenum">176</span><a name="link176" id="link176"></a> be the
      greatest hazard a character could run. This was, being maid of honour.

    <h2>
      THE VINDICTIVE BARETTI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tuesday, July 22-To-day, at noon, I had a surprise with which I was very
      well pleased. His majesty opened the door of my little parlour, called
      out, &ldquo;Come, Come in-,&rdquo; and was followed by Major Price. He was
      just arrived from his little farm in Herefordshire, and will stay here
      some days. It is particularly fortunate just now, when another gentleman
      was really required to assist in attendance upon the royal party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Seward, with a good-humoured note, sent me the magazine with Baretti&rsquo;s
      strictures on Mrs. Thrale. Good heaven, how abusive! It can hardly hurt
      her&mdash;it is so palpably meant to do it. I could not have suspected
      him, with all his violence, of a bitterness of invective so cruel, so
      ferocious!
    </p>
    <p>
      I well remember his saying to me, when first I saw him after the discovery
      of &ldquo;Evelina&rdquo;.... &ldquo;I see what it is you can do, you
      little witch&mdash;it is, that you can hang us all up for laughing-stocks;
      but hear me this one thing&mdash;don&rsquo;t meddle with me. I see what
      they are, your powers; but remember, when you provoke an Italian you run a
      dagger into your own breast!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I half shuddered at the fearful caution from him, because the dagger was a
      word of unfortunate recollection:<a href="#linknote-284"
      name="linknoteref-284" id="linknoteref-284"><small>284</small></a> but,
      good heaven! it could only be a half Shudder when the caution was against
      an offence I could sooner die than commit, and which, I may truly say, if
      personal attack was what he meant, never even in sport entered my mind,
      and was ever, in earnest, a thing I have held in the deepest abhorrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must do, however, the justice to his candour to add, that upon a newer
      acquaintance with me, which immediately followed, he never repeated his
      admonition; and when &ldquo;Cecilia&rdquo; came out, and he hastened to me
      with every species of extravagant encomium, he never hinted at any similar
      idea, and it seemed evident he concluded me, by that time, incapable<span
      class="pagenum">177</span><a name="link177" id="link177"></a> meriting
      such a suspicion; though, to judge by his own conduct, a proceeding of
      this sort may to him appear in a very different light. He thinks, at
      least, a spirit of revenge may authorize any attack, any insult. How
      unhappy and how strange! to join to so much real good nature as this man
      possesses when pleased, a disposition so savagely vindictive when
      offended.

      SPECULATIONS UPON COLONEL FAIRLY&rsquo;S RE-MARRYING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thursday, July 24&mdash;&ldquo;Pray, Miss Burney,&rdquo; cried Colonel
      Gwynn, &ldquo;do you think Mr. Fairly will ever marry again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it very doubtful,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but I hope he
      will, for, whether he is happy or not in marrying, I am sure he will be
      wretched in singleness; the whole turn of his mind is so social and
      domestic. He is by no means formed for going always abroad for the relief
      of society; he requires it more at hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think of Miss Fuzilier?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he is wholly disengaged with her and with everybody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think it will be, for I know they correspond; and what
      should he correspond with her for else?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, I suppose, he has done it long before this could be
      suggested as the motive. And, indeed, the very quickness of the report
      makes me discredit it; &rsquo;tis so utterly impossible for a man whose
      feelings are so delicate to have taken any steps towards a second
      connexion at so early a period.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      COLONEL FAIRLY AGAIN PRESENTS HIMSELF.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not long after, when all the party was broke up from my little parlour,
      though not yet set out for Gloucester, who should again surprise me by
      entering but Mr. Fairly! I was quite rejoiced by his sight. He was better,
      though not well. His face is almost reduced to its natural size. He had a
      letter for her majesty from Lord Aylesbury, and had determined to venture
      bringing it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he would carry it in to the queen, and then return to my parlour,
      if I would give him some breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may suppose I answered &ldquo;No!&rdquo; But, afterwards, fearing he
      might<span class="pagenum">178</span><a name="link178" id="link178"></a>
      be detained and fatigued, he asked me to present it for him, and only say
      he was waiting in my room for commands. I was forced to say &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
      though I had rather not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her majesty was much surprised to hear he was again out so unexpectedly,
      and asked if he thought of going to Gloucester?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I believed he was not equal to that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She bid me tell him she would see him before she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned with this message, and would then have ordered him fresh
      breakfast; but he declared if I was fidgety he should have no comfort, and
      insisted on my sitting quietly down, while he drew a chair by my side, and
      made his own cold tea, and drank it weak and vapid, and eat up all the
      miserable scraps, without suffering me to call for plate, knife, bread,
      butter, or anything for replenishment. And when he had done, and I would
      have made some apology, he affected me for him a good deal by gravely
      saying, &ldquo;Believe me, this is the pleasantest breakfast I have made
      these six days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He then went on speaking of his late confinement, and its comfortless
      circumstances, in very strong terms, dwelling on its solitude and its
      uselessness, as if those only formed its disagreeability, and the pain
      went for nothing. Social and kind is his heart, and finely touched to the
      most exquisite sensations of sympathy; and, as I told Colonel Gwynn, I
      must needs wish he may yet find some second gentle partner fitted to
      alleviate his sorrows, by giving to him an object whose happiness would
      become his first study.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought me back the few books I had procured him but I had no fresh
      supply. He spoke again of the favourite &ldquo;Letters,&rdquo; and said he
      felt so sure I should be pleased with them, that he was desirous I should
      look at them, adding, &ldquo;There is no person into whose hands I would
      not put them not even my daughter&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now impossible to avoid saying I should be glad to see them: it
      would seem else to doubt either his taste or his delicacy, while I have
      the highest opinion of both. In talking them over he told me he believed
      them to be genuine; &ldquo;But the woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;throughout
      the whole correspondence, is too much the superior. She leaves the man far
      behind. She is so collected, so composed, so constantly mistress of
      herself, so unbiased by her passions, so rational, and so dignified, that
      I would even recommend her as an example to any young woman in similar
      circumstances to follow."<span class="pagenum">179</span><a name="link179"
      id="link179"></a> He was summoned to her majesty, in the dining-parlour.
      But when they were all set out on the Gloucester expedition, he returned
      to my little parlour, and stayed with me a considerable time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grave he came back&mdash;grave quite to solemnity, and almost wholly
      immersed in deep and sad reflections, He spoke little, and that little
      with a voice so melancholy, yet so gentle, that it filled me with
      commiseration.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after much silence and many pauses, which I never attempted to
      interrupt or to dissipate, continuing my work as if not heeding him, he
      led himself distantly, yet intelligibly&mdash;to open upon the immediate
      state of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now found that the king&rsquo;s staying on at Cheltenham a fifth week
      was scarcely supportable to him; that the 16th of next month was the
      mournful anniversary of his loss, and that he had planned to dedicate it
      in some peculiar manner to her memory, with his four children. Nothing of
      this was positively said; for,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;He feels the chastity of silent woe.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But all of it was indubitably comprised in the various short but pointed
      sentences which fell from him.

    <h2>
      THE COLONEL AND THE &ldquo;ORIGINAL LOVE LETTERS.&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      Friday, July 25.&mdash;Again, to a very late breakfast came Mr. Fairly,
      which again he made for himself, when the rest were dispersed, of all the
      odd remnants, eatable and drinkable. He was much better, and less
      melancholy. He said he should be well enough to join the royal party
      to-morrow, who were to dine and spend the whole day at Lord Coventry&rsquo;s
      at Coombe....
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon, while Miss Planta and myself were Sitting over our
      dessert, a gentle rap at the parlour-door preceded Mr. Fairly. How we both
      started! He was muffled up in a great coat, and said he came quite incog.,
      as he was not well enough to dine anywhere but in his private apartment,
      nor to attend the royals to the walks, whither they go every evening. He
      had only strolled out for a walk by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not persuade him to sit down; he said he must be gone immediately,
      lest he should be seen, and the king, not aware of his unfitness, should
      order his attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta, presently, was obliged to go to the princesses,<span
      class="pagenum">180</span><a name="link180" id="link180"></a> and wait
      with them till the promenade took place. Quietly, then, he drew a chair to
      the table, and I saw he had something to say; but, after a little general
      talk he rose and was going: when, hearing by the dogs the royal family
      were just in motion, he pulled off his great coat and seated himself
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, he took from his pocket a small volume, which he said he had
      taken this opportunity to bring me. You will be sure it was the &ldquo;Original
      Letters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I took them, and thanked him: he charged me with a very grave air to keep
      them safe, and I put them into my work-box&mdash;my dear Fredy&rsquo;s
      work-box&mdash;which here is my universal repository of small goods and
      chattels, and useful past all thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time they were set off, however, we were entered into conversation,
      and he said he would venture to stay tea; &ldquo;though, as I tell you,&rdquo;
      he added, &ldquo;what I do not tell everybody, I must confess I have upon
      me some certain symptoms that make me a little suspect these Cheltenham
      waters are going to bring me to a fit of the gout.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he told me that that dreadful disorder had been frequently and
      dangerously in his family, though he had himself never had it but once,
      which was after a very bad fall from his horse when hunting with the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta now joined us, looking not a little surprised to find Mr.
      Fairly still here, and I ordered tea. After it was over, she went to take
      her usual evening exercise; and then Mr. Fairly, pointing to my work-box,
      said, &ldquo;Shall I read a little to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, I said, if it would not too much fatigue him; and then, with
      the greatest pleasure in renewing again a mode in which I had taken so
      much delight, I got my work and gave him his book. Unluckily, however, it
      was the second volume; the first, having read, he had left in town.
      &ldquo;It is quite, however,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;immaterial whether You
      begin with the first volume or the second; the story is nothing; the
      language and the sentiments are all you can care for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not quite agree in this, but would not say so, lest he should think
      of me as Colonel Gwynn does of him, that I am very romantic which,
      however, I am not, though I never like to anticipate an end ere I know a
      beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, he had not praised them too highly, nor raised my expectations
      beyond what could answer them, They are full<span class="pagenum">181</span><a
      name="link181" id="link181"></a> of beauties&mdash;moral, elegant,
      feeling, and rational. He seemed most unusually gratified by seeing me so
      much pleased with them. &ldquo;I am so glad,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;You
      like them, for I thought you would!&rdquo; But we began so late that he
      could only, get through two letters, when the time of my retiring arrived.
      I was sorry also to have him out so late after his long confinement; but
      he wrapped himself up in his great coat, and did not seem to think he
      should suffer from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta came to my room upstairs, to Inquire how long Mr. Fairly had
      stayed, and I was quite happy to appease her astonishment that he should
      come without sending in to the king, by assuring her he was only nursing
      for the next day, when he meant to attend the Coombe party.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it so absolutely right to mention his visit to the queen, lest,
      hearing of it from the princesses through Miss Planta, she Should wonder
      yet more, that I put aside the disagreeable feel of exciting that wonder
      myself, and told her he had drank tea here, when I attended her at night.
      She seemed much more surprised than pleased, till I added that he was
      preparing and hardening himself for the Coombe expedition the next day,
      and then she was quite satisfied.<a href="#linknote-285"

    <h2>
      THE GOUT AND THE LOVE LETTERS, AGAIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Saturday, July 26.&mdash;The royal party were to be Out the whole day, and
      I had her majesty&rsquo;s permission to go to the play at night with Miss
      Port and her friends, and to introduce MISS Planta to them for the same
      purpose. The breakfast was at seven o&rsquo;clock; we were all up at half
      after five. How sorry was I to see Colonel Gwynn enter alone, and to hear
      that Mr. Fairly was again ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the king came into the room and said, &ldquo;So, no Mr. Fairly
      again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; he&rsquo;s very bad this morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? His face?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; he has got the gout. These waters., he thinks, have
      brought it on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, in his foot?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; he is quite lame, his foot is swelled prodigiously."<span
      class="pagenum">182</span><a name="link182" id="link182"></a> &ldquo;So he&rsquo;s
      quite knocked up! Can&rsquo;t he come out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; he&rsquo;s obliged to order a gouty shoe and stay at home
      and nurse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The king declared the Cheltenham waters were admirable friends to the
      constitution, by bringing disorders out of the habit. Mr. Fairly, he said,
      had not been well some time, and a smart fit of the gout might set him all
      to rights again. Alas, thought I, a smart fit of the gout in a lonely
      lodging at a water-drinking place!
    </p>
    <p>
      They all presently set off; and so fatigued was my poor little frame, I
      was glad to go and lie down; but I never can sleep when I try for it in
      the daytime; the moment I cease all employment, my thoughts take such an
      ascendance over my morphetic faculty, that the attempt always ends in a
      deep and most Wakeful meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      About twelve o&rsquo;clock I was reading In my private loan book, when,
      hearing the step of Miss Planta on the stairs, I put it back in my
      work-box, and Was just taking thence some other employment, when her voice
      struck my ear almost in a scream &ldquo;Is it possible? Mr. Fairly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      My own with difficulty refrained echoing it when I heard his voice answer
      her, and in a few minutes they parted, and he rapped at the door and
      entered my little parlour. He came in hobbling, leaning on a stick, and
      with a large cloth shoe over one of his feet, which was double the size of
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat down together, and he soon inquired what I had done with his little
      book. I had only, I answered, read two more letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you read two?&rdquo; he cried, in a voice rather disappointed;
      and I found he was actually come to devote the morning, which he knew to
      be unappropriated on my part, to reading it on to me himself. Then he took
      up the book and read on from the fifth letter. But he read at first with
      evident uneasiness, throwing down the book at every noise, and stopping to
      listen at every sound. At last he asked me if anybody was likely to come?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a soul, I said, that I knew or expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed a little at his question and apparent anxiety but with an
      openness that singularly marks his character, he frankly added, &ldquo;I
      must put the book away, pure as it is, if any one comes or, without
      knowing a word of the contents, they will run away with the title alone,
      exclaiming, &lsquo;Mr. Fairly<span class="pagenum">183</span><a
      name="link183" id="link183"></a> reading love letters to Miss Burney!&rsquo;
      A fine story that would make!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pon honour, thought I, I would not hear such a tale for the world.
      However, he now pursued his reading more at his ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not tell you what we said of them in talking them over. Our praise
      I have chiefly given&mdash;our criticism must wait till you have read them
      yourselves. They are well worth your seeking. I am greatly mistaken if you
      do not read them with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the discussion he glided, I know not how, upon the
      writings of another person, saying he never yet had talked them over with
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is much kinder not,&rdquo; cried I hastily....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; cried he laughing, &ldquo;may I find a fault?
      Will you hear a criticism, if nothing of another sort?&rdquo; I was forced
      to accede to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told me, then, there was one thing he wholly disallowed and wished to
      dispute, which was, Cecilia&rsquo;s refusing to be married on account of
      the anonymous prohibition to the ceremony. He could not, he said, think
      such an implied distrust of Delvile, after consenting to be his, was fair
      or generous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To that,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;I cannot judge what a man may
      think, but I will own it is what most precisely and indubitably I could
      not have resisted doing myself. An interruption so mysterious and so
      shocking I could never have had the courage to pass over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This answer rather silenced him from politeness than convinced him from
      reason, for I found he thought the woman who had given her promise was
      already married, and ought to run every risk rather than show the smallest
      want of confidence in the man of her choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Columb now soon came in to inquire what time I should dine, but a ghost
      could not have made him stare more than Mr. Fairly, whose confinement with
      the gout had been spread all over the house by Colonel Gwynn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ordered an early dinner on account of the play.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you invite me,&rdquo; cried Mr. Fairly, laughing, &ldquo;to
      dine with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;with the greatest pleasure.&rdquo;
      and he said he would go to his home and dress, and return to my hour.<span

    <h2>
      A DINNER WITH COLONEL FAIRLY AND MISS PLANTA.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As he was at leisure, I had bespoke the queen&rsquo;s hairdresser, on
      account of the play; but Miss Planta came to inform me that she could not
      be of that party, as she had received a letter from Lady Charlotte Finch,
      concerning Princess Mary, that she must stay to deliver herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her she would have a beau at dinner. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis the oddest thing in the world He should come
      so when the king and queen are away! I am sure, if I was you, I would not
      mention it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I shall,&rdquo; cried I; &ldquo;I receive no visitors in
      private; and I am sure if I did, Mr. Fairly is the last who would
      condescend to make one of them.&rdquo; Such was my proud, but true speech,
      for him and for myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner we all three met; Mr. Fairly in much better spirits than I have
      yet seen him at Cheltenham. He attacks Miss Planta upon all her little
      prejudices, and rallies her into a defence of them, in a manner so
      sportive &rsquo;tis impossible to hurt her, yet so nearly sarcastic that
      she is frequently perplexed whether to take it in good or ill part. But
      his intentions are so decidedly averse to giving pain, that even when she
      is most alarmed at finding the laugh raised against her, some suddenly
      good-humoured or obliging turn sets all to rights, and secures any sting
      from remaining, even where the bee has been most menacing to fix itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe Mr. Fairly to possess from nature high animal spirits, though
      now curbed by misfortune and a fine vein of satire, though constantly kept
      in order by genuine benevolence. He is still, in mixed company, gay,
      shrewd, and arch; foremost in badinage, and readiest for whatever may
      promote general entertainment. But in chosen society his spirits do not
      rise above cheerfulness; he delights in moral discourse, on grave and
      instructive subjects, and though always ready to be led to the politics or
      business of the day, in which he is constantly well versed and informing I
      never observe him to lead but to themes of religion, literature, or moral
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dinner and a very sociable dessert were over, we proposed going to
      the king&rsquo;s dining-parlour, while the servants removed the things,
      etc., against tea. But the weather was so very fine we were tempted by the
      open door to go out into the air. Miss Planta said she would take a walk;
      Mr. Fairly could not, but all without was so beautiful he would not go
      into the<span class="pagenum">185</span><a name="link185" id="link185"></a>
      parlour, and rather risked the fatigue of standing, as he leant against
      the porch, to losing the lovely prospect of sweet air.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here, for near two hours, on the steps of Fauconberg Hall, we
      remained; and they were two hours of such pure serenity, without and
      within, as I think, except in Norbury park, with its loved inhabitants and
      my Susan, I scarce ever remember to have spent. Higher gaiety and greater
      happiness many and many periods of my life have at different times
      afforded me; but a tranquillity more perfect has only, I think, been lent
      to me in Norbury park, where, added to all else that could soothe and
      attract, every affection of my heart could be expanded and indulged. But
      what have I to do with a comparison no longer cherished but by memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time I have mentioned being past, Miss Planta returned from her walk,
      and we adjourned to the little parlour, where I made tea, and then I
      equipped myself for the play.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweet Miss Port received me with her usual kind joy, and introduced me
      to her friends, who are Mr. Delabere, the master of the house, and chief
      magistrate of Cheltenham, and his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all proceeded to the play-house, which is a very pretty little theatre.
      Mrs. Jordan played the &ldquo;Country Girl,&rdquo; most admirably; but the
      play is so disagreeable in Its whole plot and tendency, that all the merit
      of her performance was insufficient to ward off disgust.<a
      href="#linknote-286" name="linknoteref-286" id="linknoteref-286"><small>286</small></a>
      My principal end, however, was wholly answered, in spending the evening
      with my poor M&mdash;&mdash;-....
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Harcourt is come to take the place of Lady Weymouth, whose waiting is
      over; and Lord Harcourt will lodge in the town of Cheltenham. We have no
      room here for double accommodations.

    <h2>
      ROYAL CONCERN FOR THE COLONEL&rsquo;s GOUT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sunday, July 27.&mdash;This morning in my first attendance I seized a
      moment to tell her majesty of yesterday&rsquo;s dinner.<span
      class="pagenum">186</span><a name="link186" id="link186"></a> &ldquo;So I
      hear!&rdquo; she cried; and I was sorry any one had anticipated my
      information, nor can I imagine who it might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But pray, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; very gravely, &ldquo;how did it
      happen? I understood Mr. Fairly was confined by the gout.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He grew better, ma&rsquo;am, and hoped by exercise to prevent a
      serious fit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She said no more, but did not seem pleased. The fatigues of a Court
      attendance are so little comprehended, that persons known to be able to
      quit their room and their bed are Instantly concluded to be qualified for
      all the duties of their office.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were again very early, as their majesties meant to go to the cathedral
      at Gloucester, where the Bishop of Gloucester, Dr. Halifax, was to Preach
      to them. But I-was particularly glad, before our breakfast, was over, to
      see Mr. Fairly enter my little parlour. He was Still In his gouty Shoe,
      and assisted by a stick, but he had not suffered from his yesterday&rsquo;s
      exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the things were removed, a page opened the door, and all the royal
      family&mdash;king, queen, and three princesses&mdash;came into the room to
      see Mr. Fairly and Inquire how he did. I hardly know with which of the
      five he is most in favour, or by which most respected, and they all
      expressed their concern for this second attack, in the kindest terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, however, who has a flow of spirits at this time quite
      unequalled, would fain have turned the whole into ridicule, and have
      persuaded him he was only fanciful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanciful, Sir?&rdquo; he repeated, a little displeased; and the
      good king perceiving it, graciously and good-humouredly drew back his
      words, by saying &ldquo;Why I should wonder indeed if you were to be that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When they all decamped I prepared for church. I had appointed to go with
      Miss Port, and to meet her on the road. Mr. Fairly said, if I would give
      him leave, he would stay and write letters in my little parlour. I
      supplied him with materials, and emptied my queen&rsquo;s writing-box for
      a desk, as we possess nothing here but a low dining-table. So away went
      journals, letters, memorandums, etc., into the red portfolio given me by
      my dear father.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">187</span><a name="link187" id="link187"></a>As soon
      as I presented him with this, not at all aware of the goods and chattels
      removed for the occasion, he said it was so very comfortable he should now
      write all his letters here, for at his lodgings he had such a miserable
      low table he had been forced to prop it up by brick-bats!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairly sealed and made up his dispatches, and then said he would
      stroll a little out to put his foot in motion. &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; he
      asked, &ldquo;shall you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a great mind to say, Why, stroll with you; for that, I think, was
      the meaning OF his question; but I feared it might prevent my being
      dressed against the return Of the queen, and I do not think she would have
      thought it an adequate excuse.

    <h2>
      YOUNG REPUBLICANS CONVERTED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Monday, July 28.&mdash;-Miss Ogle acquainted me that this was the last day
      of her remaining at Cheltenham, and I promised to drink tea with her in
      the afternoon; and the queen honoured me with a commission to bring Mrs.
      Ogle on the walks, as his majesty wished again to see her....
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Mrs. Ogle and her daughters all civility and good humour. Poor
      Mrs. Ogle has lately (by what means I do not know) wholly lost her
      eye-sight; but she is perfectly resigned to this calamity, and from
      motives just such as suit a bishop&rsquo;s daughter. When I told her who
      desired her to be on the walks, she was extremely gratified. Spotty is a
      complete rebel, according to the principles of her republican father, and
      protested it would only be a folly and fuss to go, for their notice. The
      younger sisters are bred rebels too; but the thought of guiding their
      mother, when such royal distinction was intended her, flattered and
      fluctuated them. There was another lady with them, who told me that Dr.
      Warton, of Winchester, had desired her to make acquaintance with me; but I
      have forgotten her name, and have no time to refresh my memory with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the walks we went, the good and pious Mrs. Ogle between her two young
      daughters, and Spotty and I together. Spotty begged me to go to the ball
      with her, but I had neither licence nor inclination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen immediately espied Mrs. Ogle, by seeing me, as I heard her say
      to the king; and they approached the spot where we stood, in the most
      gracious manner. The king spoke with such kindness to Mrs. Ogle, and with
      such great regard<span class="pagenum">188</span><a name="link188"
      id="link188"></a> of her late father, that the good lady was most deeply
      affected with pleasure. I believe they stayed half an hour with her,
      talking over old scenes and circumstances. Spotty kept pulling me all the
      time, to decamp; but I kept &ldquo;invincible,&rdquo;&mdash;not quite like
      Mr. Pitt, yet &ldquo;invincible.&rdquo; At last the king spoke to her:
      this confused her so much, between the pleasure of the notice, and the
      shame of feeling that pleasure, that she knew not what she either did or
      said, answered everything wrong, and got out of the line, and stood with
      her back to the queen, and turned about she knew not why, and behaved like
      one who had lost her wits.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they left us, Mrs. Ogle expressed her grateful sense of the honour
      done her, almost with tears; the two young ones said, they had never
      conceived the king and queen could be such sweet people and poor Spotty
      was so affected and so constrained in denying them praise, and persisting
      that she thought it &ldquo;all a bore,&rdquo; that I saw the republican
      heart was gone, though the tongue held its ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second time, after a few more turns, the same gracious party approached,
      with fresh recollections and fresh questions concerning interesting family
      matters. This was more than could be withstood; Mrs. Ogle was almost
      overpowered by their condescension; the young ones protested they should
      never bear to hear anything but praise of them all their lives to come and
      poor Spotty was quite dumb! She could not, for shame, join the chorus of
      praise, and to resist it she had no longer any power.
    </p>
    <p>
      We did not, however, stop here; for still a third time they advanced, and
      another conference ensued, in which Mrs. Ogle&rsquo;s sons were inquired
      for, and their way of life, and designs and characters. This ended and
      completed the whole; Mrs. Ogle no longer restrained the tears of pleasure
      from flowing; her little daughters declared, aloud, the king and queen
      were the two most sweet persons in the whole world, and they would say so
      as long as they lived; and poor Spotty, colouring and conscious, said&mdash;&ldquo;But
      I hope I did not behave so bad this time as the first?&rdquo; Nay, so
      wholly was she conquered, that, losing her stubbornness more and more by
      reflection, she would not let me take leave till she obliged me to promise
      I would either call the next morning, before their departure, or write her
      a little note, to say if they found out or mentioned her ungraciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was too well pleased in the convert to refuse her this satisfaction;
      <span class="pagenum">189</span><a name="link189" id="link189"></a>and so
      full was her mind of her new loyalty, that when she found me steady in
      declining to go with her to the ball, she gave it up herself, and said she

    <h2>
      THE PRINCES&rsquo; ANIMAL SPIRITS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      July 31.&mdash;Miss Planta said the Duke of York was expected the next
      day. This led to much discourse on the princes, in which Mr. Fairly, with
      his usual but Most uncommon openness, protested there was something in the
      violence of their animal spirits that would make him accept no post and no
      pay to live with them. Their very voices, he said, had a loudness and
      force that wore him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after he made a little attack&mdash;a gentle one, Indeed&mdash;upon
      me, for the contrary extreme, of hardly speaking, among strangers at
      least, so as to be heard. &ldquo;And why,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;do you
      speak so low? I used formerly not to catch above a word in a sentence from
      you.&rdquo; In talking about the princes, he asked me how I managed with
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not at all, I said, for since I had resided under the royal roof they were
      rarely there, and I had merely seen them two or three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      He congratulated me that I had not been in the family in earlier days,
      when they all lived together; and Miss Planta enumerated various of their
      riots, and the distresses and difficulties they caused in the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was very glad, I said, to be out of the way, though I did not doubt but
      I might have kept clear of them had I been even then a resident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no, no,&rdquo; cried Mr. Fairly; &ldquo;they would have come to
      you, I promise you; and what could you have done&mdash;what would have
      become of you?&mdash;with Prince William in particular? Do you not think,
      Miss Planta, the Prince of Wales and Prince William would have been quite
      enough for Miss Burney? Why she would have been quite subdued.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I assured him I had not a fear but I might always have avoided them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! They would have come to your tea-room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have given up tea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they would have followed you&mdash;called for you&mdash;sent
      for you&mdash;the Prince of Wales would have called about him, &lsquo;Here!
      where&rsquo;s Miss Burney?&rsquo;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">190</span><a
      name="link190" id="link190"></a> &ldquo;O, no, no, no!&rdquo; cried I;
      &ldquo;I would have kept wholly out of the way, and then they would never
      have thought about me.&rdquo; &ldquo;O, ho!&rdquo; cried he, laughing,
      &ldquo;never think of seeing Miss Burney Prince William, too! what say you
      to that, Miss Planta?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She agreed there was no probability of such escape. I was only the more
      glad to have arrived in later times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a page came to call Mr. Fairly to backgammon with his majesty.

    <h2>
      THE DUKE OF YORK: ROYAL VISIT TO THE THEATRE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Friday, Aug. 1.&mdash;This was a very busy day; the Duke of York was
      expected, and his fond father had caused a portable wooden house to be
      moved from the further end of Cheltenham town up to join to Fauconber,
      Hall. The task had employed twenty or thirty men almost ever since our
      arrival, and so laborious, slow, difficult, and all but impracticable had
      it proved, that it was barely accomplished before it was wanted. There was
      no room, however, in the king&rsquo;s actual dwelling, and he could not
      endure not to accommodate his son immediately next himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      His joy upon his arrival was such joy as I have only seen here when he
      arrived first from Germany; I do not mean it was equally violent, or,
      alas! equally unmixed, but yet it was next and nearest to that which had
      been most perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bunbury attended his royal highness. We had all dispersed from
      breakfast, but the king came in, and desired me to make him some. Mr.
      Fairly had brought him to my little parlour, and, having called Columb,
      and assisted in arranging a new breakfast, he left us, glad, I suppose, of
      a morning to himself, for his majesty was wholly engrossed by the duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      We talked over his usual theme&mdash;plays and players&mdash;and he
      languished to go to the theatre and see Mrs. Jordan. Nor did he languish
      in vain: his royal master, the duke, imbibed his wishes, and conveyed them
      to the king; and no sooner were they known than an order was hastily sent
      to the play-house, to prepare a royal box. The queen was so gracious as to
      order Miss Planta and myself to have the same entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delight of the people that their king and queen should visit this
      country theatre was the most disinterested I ever witnessed; for though
      they had not even a glance of their royal countenances, they shouted,
      huzzaed, and clapped, for<span class="pagenum">191</span><a name="link191"
      id="link191"></a> many minutes. The managers had prepared the front boxes
      for their reception, and therefore the galleries were over them. They made
      a very full and respectable appearance in this village theatre. The king,
      queen, Duke of York, and three princesses, were all accommodated with
      front seats; Lord Harcourt stood behind the king, Lady Harcourt and Mr.
      Fairly behind the queen; Lord and Lady Courtown and Lady Pembroke behind
      the princesses; and at the back, Colonel Gwynn and Mr. Bunbury; Mr. Boulby
      and Lady Mary were also in the back group.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was somewhat taken up in observing a lady who sat opposite to me, Miss W&mdash;-.
      My Susanna will remember that extraordinary young lady at Bath, whose
      conduct and conversation I have either written or repeated to her.<a
      href="#linknote-287" name="linknoteref-287" id="linknoteref-287"><small>287</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not see her again without being much struck by another
      recollection, of more recent and vexatious date. Mrs. Thrale, in one of
      the letters she has published, and which was written just after I had
      communicated to her my singular rencontre with this lady, says to Dr.
      Johnson, &ldquo;Burney has picked up an infidel, and recommended to her to
      read &lsquo;Rasselas.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This has a strange sound, but when its circumstances are known, its
      strangeness ceases; it meant Miss W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and I greatly
      fear, from the date and the book, she cannot but know the &ldquo;infidel&rdquo;
      and herself are one. I was truly Concerned in reading it, and I now felt
      almost ashamed as well as concerned in facing her, though her infidelity
      at that time, was of her own public avowal. Mr. Bunbury is particularly
      intimate with her, and admires her beyond all women.

    <h2>
      AN UN-COURTLY VISITOR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Planta and myself, by the queen&rsquo;s direction, went in a chaise
      to see Tewkesbury. We were carried to several very beautiful points of
      view, all terminating with the noble hills of Malvern; and we visited the
      cathedral.... The pews seem the most unsafe, strange, and irregular that
      were ever constructed; they are mounted up, story after story, without any
      order, now large, now small, now projecting out wide, now almost indented
      in back, nearly to the very roof of the building. They look as if,
      ready-made, they had been thrown up, and stuck wherever they could,
      entirely by chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We returned home just in time to be hastily dressed before<span
      class="pagenum">192</span><a name="link192" id="link192"></a> the royals
      came back. I was a little, however, distressed on being told, as I
      descended to dinner, that Mr. Richard Burney<a href="#linknote-288"
      name="linknoteref-288" id="linknoteref-288"><small>288</small></a> was in
      my parlour. The strict discipline observed here, in receiving no visits,
      made this a very awkward circumstance, for I as much feared hurting him by
      such a hint, as concurring in an impropriety by detaining him. Miss Planta
      suffers not a soul to approach her to this house; and Lady Harcourt has
      herself told me she thinks it would be wrong to receive even her sisters,
      Miss Vernons, so much all-together is now the house and household!
    </p>
    <p>
      My difficulty was still increased, when, upon entering the parlour, I
      found him in boots, a riding dress, and hair wholly without curl or
      dressing. Innocently, and very naturally, he had called upon me in his
      travelling garb, never suspecting that in visiting me he was at all in
      danger of seeing or being seen by any one else. Had that indeed been the
      case, I should have been very glad to see him; but I knew, now, his
      appearance must prove every way to his disadvantage, and I felt an added
      anxiety to acquaint him with my situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta looked all amazement; but he was himself all ease and
      sprightly unconsciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were obliged to sit down to dinner; he had dined. I was quite in a
      panic the whole time, lest any of the royals should come in before I could
      speak&mdash;but, after he had partaken of our dessert, as much en badinage
      as I could, I asked him if he felt stout enough to meet the king? and then
      explained to him, as concisely as I had power, that I had here no room
      whatsoever at my own disposal, in such a manner as to enable my having the
      happiness to receive any of my private friends even Miss Port, though
      known to all the royal family, I could never venture to invite, except
      when they were abroad: such being, at present, the universal practice and
      forbearance of all the attendants in this tour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard me with much surprise, and much laughter at his own elegant
      equipment for such encounters as those to which he now found himself
      liable; but he immediately proposed decamping, and I could not object,
      Yet, to soften this disagreeable explanation, I kept him a few minutes
      longer, settling concerning our further meeting at the concerts at
      Worcester, and, in this little interval, we were startled by a rap at my
      door. He laughed, and started back; and I, alarmed,<span class="pagenum">193</span><a
      name="link193" id="link193"></a> also retreated. Miss Planta opened the
      door, and called out &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis Mr. Fairly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw him in amaze at sight of a gentleman; and he was himself immediately
      retiring, concluding, I suppose, that nothing less than business very
      urgent could have induced me to break through rules so rigidly observed by
      himself and all others. I would not, however, let him go, but as I
      continued talking with Richard about the music meeting and my cousins, he
      walked up to the window with Miss Planta. I now kept Richard as long as I
      well could, to help off his own embarrassment at this interruption; at
      length he went.

    <h2>
      MR. FAIRLY READS &ldquo;AKENSIDE&rdquo; TO MISS BURNEY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hearing now the barking of the dogs, I knew the royals must be going forth
      to their promenade; but I found Mr. Fairly either did not hear or did not
      heed them. While I expected him every moment to recollect himself, and
      hasten to the walks, he quietly said, &ldquo;They are all gone but me. I
      shall venture, to-night, to shirk;&mdash;though the king will soon miss
      me. But what will follow? He will say&mdash;&lsquo;Fairly is tired! How
      shabby!&rsquo; Well! let him say so; I am tired!&rdquo; Miss Planta went
      off, soon after, to her walk. He then said, &ldquo;Have you done with my
      little book?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;and this morning I have sent home the
      map of Gloucester you were so good as to send us. Though, I believe, I
      have kept both so long, You will not again be in any haste to lend me
      either a map of the land, or a poem of the sea.&rdquo; I then gave him
      back &ldquo;The Shipwreck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;a design I have been
      forming upon you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A design upon me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and I may as well own it, for I shall be quite as near success
      as if I disguise it.&rdquo; I then went to my little drawer and took out
      Akenside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;I intended to have had this fall in
      your way, by pure accident, on the evening you were called to the
      conjurer, and I have planned the same ingenious project every evening
      since, but it has never taken, and so now I produce it fairly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; cried he, taking it, with a very pleased smile,
      &ldquo;is the only way in all things!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">194</span><a
      name="link194" id="link194"></a> He then began reading &ldquo;The
      Pleasures of the Imagination,&rdquo; and I took some work, for which I was
      much in haste, and my imagination was amply gratified. He only looked out
      for favourite passages, as he has the poem almost by heart, and he read
      them with a feeling and energy that showed his whole soul penetrated with
      their force and merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first hour, however, he grew uneasy&rsquo;; he asked me when I
      expected the king and queen from their walk, and whether they were likely
      to come into my room?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;was uncertain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can nobody,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;let you know when they are
      coming?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;would know till they were
      actually arrived.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;can you not bid somebody watch?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Twas rather an awkward commission, but I felt it would be an awkwardness
      still less pleasant to me to decline it, and therefore I called Columb,
      and desired he would let me know when the queen returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was then easier, and laughed a little, while he explained himself,
      &ldquo;Should they come in and find me reading here before I could put
      away my book, they would say we were two blue stockings!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At tea Miss Planta again joined us, and instantly behind him went the
      book. He was very right; for nobody would have thought it more odd&mdash;or
      more blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this repast they returned home, but all went straight upstairs, the
      duke wholly occupying the king&mdash;and Mr. Bunbury went to the play.
      When Miss Planta, therefore, took her evening stroll, &ldquo;Akenside&rdquo;
      again came forth, and with more security.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one ode here,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that I wish to read
      to you, and now I think I can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him I did not in general like Akenside&rsquo;s odes, at least what
      I had chanced to read, for I thought they were too inflated, and filled
      with &ldquo;liberty cant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this, however,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I must read to you, it
      is so pretty, though it is upon love!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tis addressed to Olympia: I dare say my dearest Fredy recollects it.<a
      href="#linknote-289" name="linknoteref-289" id="linknoteref-289"><small>289</small></a>
      It is, indeed, most feelingly written; but we<span class="pagenum">195</span><a
      name="link195" id="link195"></a> had only got through the first stanza
      when the door Suddenly opened, and enter Mr. Bunbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all the precautions taken, to have him thus appear at the very worst
      moment! Vexed as I was, I could really have laughed; but Mr. Fairly was
      ill disposed to take it so merrily. He started, threw the book forcibly
      behind him, and instantly took up his hat, as if decamping. I really
      believe he was afraid Mr. Bunbury would caricature us &ldquo;The
      sentimental readers!&rdquo; or what would he have called us? Luckily this
      confusion passed unnoticed. Mr. Bunbury had run away from the play to see
      after the horses, etc., for his duke, and was fearful of coming too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plays and players now took up all the discourse, with Miss W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      till the duke was ready to go. They then left me together, Mr. Fairly
      smiling drolly enough in departing, and looking at &ldquo;Akenside&rdquo;
      with a very arch shrug, as who should say &ldquo;What a scrape you had
      nearly drawn me into, Mr. Akenside!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE DOCTOR&rsquo;s EMBARRASSMENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sunday, Aug. 3.&mdash;This morning I was so violently oppressed by a cold,
      which turns out to be the influenza, it was with the utmost difficulty I
      could dress myself. I did indeed now want some assistant most wofully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess royal has already been some days disturbed with this
      influenza. When the queen perceived it in me she told his majesty, who
      came into the room just as she was going to breakfast. Without making any
      answer, he himself went immediately to call Mr. Clerk, the apothecary, who
      was then with the princess royal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Clerk,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s another
      patient for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clerk, a modest, sensible man, concluded, by the king himself having
      called him, that it was the queen he had<span class="pagenum">196</span><a
      name="link196" id="link196"></a> now to attend, and he stood bowing
      profoundly before her but soon observing she did not notice him, he turned
      in some confusion to the Princess Augusta, who was now in the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! it&rsquo;s not me, Mr. Clerk, thank God!&rdquo; cried the
      gay Princess Augusta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still more confused, the poor man advanced to Princess Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; it&rsquo;s not her!&rdquo; cried the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had held back, having scarce power to open my eyes, from a vehement
      head-ache, and not, indeed, wishing to go through my examination till
      there were fewer witnesses. But his majesty now drew me out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Mr. Clerk,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;this is your new patient!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He then came bowing up to me, the king standing close by, and the rest
      pretty near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you are not well, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; he cried in the
      greatest embarrassment,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, not quite,&rdquo; I answered in ditto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, Mr. Clerk will cure you!&rdquo; cried the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are-are you feverish, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, a little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I will send you a saline draught, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he bowed and decamped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you ever hear a more perfectly satisfactory examination? The poor
      modest man was overpowered by such royal listeners and spectators, and I
      could not possibly relieve him, for I was little better myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went down to breakfast, but was so exceedingly oppressed I could not
      hold up my head, and as soon as I could escape I went to my own room, and
      laid down till my noon attendance, which I performed with so much
      difficulty I was obliged to return to the same indulgence the moment I was
      at liberty.

    <h2>
      FROM GRAVE TO GAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Down at last I went, slow and wrapped up. I found Mr. Fairly alone in the
      parlour, reading letters with such intentness that he did not raise his
      head, and with an air of the deepest dejection. I remained wholly
      unnoticed a considerable time; but at last he looked up, and with some
      surprise, but a voice OF<span class="pagenum">197</span><a name="link197"
      id="link197"></a> of extreme sadness, he said, &ldquo;Is that Miss Burney?
      I thought it had been Miss Planta.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged him to read on, and not mind me; and I called for tea. When we
      had done tea, &ldquo;See, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I have
      brought You &lsquo;Carr,&rsquo; and here is a sermon upon the text I mean,
      when I preach, to choose &lsquo;Keep innocency, and take heed to the thing
      that is right; for that will bring a man peace at the last.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely I commended his choice; and we had a most solemn discussion of
      happiness, not such as coincides with gaiety here, but hope of salvation
      hereafter. His mind has so religious a propensity, that it seems to me,
      whenever he leaves it to its natural bent, to incline immediately and
      instinctively to subjects of that holy nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humility, he said, in conclusion, humility was all in all for tranquillity
      of mind; with that, little was expected and much was borne, and the
      smallest good was a call for gratitude and content. How could this man be
      a soldier? Might one not think he was bred in the cloisters?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried he, again taking up the volume of &ldquo;Carr,&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will just sit and read this sermon, and then quietly go home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so, feelingly, forcibly, solemnly; it is an excellent sermon; yet
      so read&mdash;he so sad, and myself so ill&mdash;it was almost too much
      for me, and I had some difficulty to behave with proper propriety. To him
      subjects of this sort, ill or well, bring nothing, I believe, but strength
      as well as comfort. The voice of dejection with which he began changed to
      one of firmness ere he had read three pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something he saw of unusual sinking, notwithstanding what I hid; and, with
      a very kind concern, when he had finished the sermon, he said, &ldquo;Is
      there anything upon your spirits?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I assured him, &ldquo;but I was not well; and mind and
      body seemed to go together sometimes, when they did not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they do go together,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;and will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he took no further notice: he is like me, for myself, in that&mdash;that
      whatever he thinks only bodily is little worth attention; and I did not
      care to risk explaining to his strong and virtuous mind the many fears and
      mixed sensations of mine, when brought to a close disquisition of awaiting
      eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never, but with Mrs. Delany and Dr. Johnson, have entered so fully and
      so frequently upon this awful subject as<span class="pagenum">198</span><a
      name="link198" id="link198"></a> with Mr. Fairly. My dear and most revered
      Mrs. Delany dwelt upon it continually, with joy, and pure, yet humble
      hope. My ever-honoured Dr. Johnson recurred to it perpetually, with a
      veneration compounded of diffidence and terror, and an incessant, yet
      unavailing plan, of amending all errors, and rising into perfection. Mr.
      Fairly leans upon it as the staff of his strength&mdash;the trust, the
      hope, the rest of his soul&mdash;too big for satisfaction in aught this
      world has given, or can reserve for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not, however, &ldquo;go quietly home,&rdquo; when he had finished
      the sermon; on the contrary, he revived in his spirits, and animated in
      his discourse, and stayed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      In speaking of the king he suddenly recollected some very fine lines of
      Churchill, made on his accession to the throne. I wish I could transcribe
      them, they are so applicable to that good king, from that moment of
      promise to the present of performance. But I know not in what part of
      Churchill&rsquo;s works they may be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding me unacquainted with his poems he then repeated several passages,
      all admirably chosen; but among them his memory called forth some that
      were written upon Lord H&mdash;, which were of the bitterest severity I
      ever heard:&mdash;whether deserved or not, Heaven knows; but Mr. Fairly
      said he would repeat them, for the merit of the composition. There was no
      examining his opinion of their veracity, and he made no comments; but
      this: Lord H&mdash;&mdash;- was the famous man so often in the House of
      Commons accused of expending, or retaining, unaccounted millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having run through all he could immediately recollect, he said, with a
      very droll smile, &ldquo;Come, now I&rsquo;ll finish our ode,&rdquo; and
      went to my drawer for &ldquo;Akenside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His fears of surprise, however, again came upon him so strongly while
      reading it, that he flung away the book in the utmost commotion at every
      sound, lest any one was entering, always saying in excuse, &ldquo;We must
      not be called two blue stockings;&rdquo; and, &ldquo;They are so glad to
      laugh; the world is so always on the watch for ridicule.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      I know not by what means, but after this we talked over Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s
      trial. I find he is very much acquainted with Mr. Windham, and I surprised
      him not a little, I saw, by what I told him of part Of My conferences with
      that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      This matter having led us from our serious subjects, he took<span
      class="pagenum">199</span><a name="link199" id="link199"></a> up &ldquo;Akenside&rdquo;
      once more, and read to me the first book throughout, What a very, very
      charming poem is the &ldquo;Pleasures of the Imagination!&rdquo; He stayed
      to the last moment, and left me all the better for the time he thus
      rescued from feverish lassitude and suffering.

    <h2>
      A VISIT TO WORCESTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tuesday, Aug. 5&mdash;The journey to Worcester was very pleasant, and the
      country through which we passed extremely luxuriant and pretty. We did not
      go in by the Barborne road; but all the road, and all avenues leading to
      it, were lined with people, and when we arrived at the city we could see
      nothing but faces; they lined the windows from top to bottom, and the
      pavement from end to end.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drove all through the city to come to the palace of Bishop Hurd, at
      which we were to reside. Upon stopping there, the king had an huzza that
      seemed to vibrate through the whole town; the princess royal&rsquo;s
      carriage had a second, and the equerries a third; the mob then, as ours
      drew on in succession, seemed to deliberate whether or not we also should
      have a cheer: but one of them soon decided the matter by calling out,
      &ldquo;These are the maids of honour!&rdquo; and immediately they gave us
      an huzza that made us quite ashamed, considering its vicinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairly and Colonel Goldsworthy having performed the royal attendance,
      waited to hand us out of the carriage; and then the former said he
      believed he should not be wanted, and would go and make a visit in the
      town. I should have much liked walking off also, and going to my cousins
      at Barborne Lodge; but I was no free agent, and obliged to wait for
      commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house is old and large; part of it looks to the Severn but the
      celebrated &ldquo;Fair Sabrina&rdquo; was so thick and muddy, that at this
      time her vicinity added but little to the beauty of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      My bed-room is pleasant, with a view of the distant country and the Severn
      beneath it; but it is through that of the princess royal; which is an
      inconvenience her royal highness submits to with a grace that would make
      me ashamed to call it one to myself. The parlour for our eating is large
      and dark, and old-fashioned. I made tea in it to-night for Lord Courtown
      and the two colonels, and Miss Planta, and was so much the<span
      class="pagenum">200</span><a name="link200" id="link200"></a> better for
      my journey, that I felt the influenza nearly conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday, Aug. 6.&mdash;I had the pleasure to arrange going to the music
      meeting with my own family. Notes were immediately interchanged from and
      to Barborne Lodge, and the queen was very well pleased that I should have
      this opportunity of joining my friends. Mr. and Mrs. Hawkins and Betsy
      called for me at the bishop&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was heartily glad to see Betsy and Mrs. Hawkins I introduced Miss Planta
      to them, who was of our party. We sat in what are called the steward&rsquo;s
      places, immediately under their majesties. The performance was very long,
      and tolerably tedious, consisting of Handel&rsquo;s gravest pieces and
      fullest choruses, and concluding with a sermon concerning the institution
      of the charity, preached by Dr. Langhorne. I was, however, so glad to be
      with my cousins, that the morning was very comfortable and pleasant to me.
      Richard and James joined us occasionally; the rest of the family are at
      Shrewsbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was over very late, and we then went about the church, to see King John&rsquo;s
      tomb, etc, They were very earnest with me to go to Barborne but it was
      impossible. I promised, however, to accompany them to the concert at
      night, and be of their party to all the morning meetings at the cathedral.
    </p>
    <p>
      My parlour at the bishop&rsquo;s afforded me a good deal of entertainment,
      from observing the prodigious concourse of people from all the tops of
      houses, and looking over the walls to watch his majesty&rsquo;s entrance
      into the court-yard. Poor Lord Courtown, on account of his star, was
      continually taken for the king, and received so many huzzas and shouts,
      that he hardly dared show himself except when in attendance.

    <h2>
      THE QUEEN AND MR. FAIRLY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Saturday, Aug. 9.&mdash;Her majesty this morning a little surprised me by
      gravely asking me what were Mr. Fairly&rsquo;s designs with regard to his
      going away? I could not tell her I did not know what I was really
      acquainted with; yet I feared it might seem odd to her that I should be
      better informed than herself, and it was truly unpleasant to me to relate
      anything he had told me without his leave. Her question, therefore, gave
      me a painful sensation; but it was spoken with an air so strongly denoting
      a belief that I had power to answer it, that I felt no choice in making a
      plain reply. Simply, then, &ldquo;I understand,<span class="pagenum">201</span><a
      name="link201" id="link201"></a> ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that
      he means to go to-morrow morning early.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he stay on to-night, then, at Worcester?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-o, ma&rsquo;am, I believe not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he meant to leave us to-day? He said so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He intended it, ma&rsquo;am,&mdash;he would else not have said it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I understood so, though he has not spoke to me of his
      designs this great while.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw an air bordering upon displeasure as this was said and how sorry I
      felt!&mdash;and how ashamed of being concluded the person better informed!
      Yet, as he had really related to me his plan, and I knew it to be what he
      had thought most respectful to herself, I concluded it best, thus
      catechised, to speak it all, and therefore, after some hesitation
      uninterrupted by her, I said, &ldquo;I believe, ma&rsquo;am, Mr. Fairly
      had intended fully to begin his journey to-day, but, as Your majesty is to
      go to the play to-night, he thinks it his duty to defer setting out till
      to-morrow, that he may have the honour to attend your majesty as usual.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This, which was the exact truth, evidently pleased her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the inquiry dropped; but I was very uneasy to relate it to Mr.
      Fairly, that the sacrifice I knew he meant to make of another day might
      not lose all its grace by wanting to be properly revealed.

    <h2>
      MR. FAIRLY MORALIZES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our journey back to Cheltenham was much more quiet than it had been to
      Worcester, for the royal party too; another route to see Malvern hills,
      and we went straight forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta having now caught the influenza, suffered very much all the
      way, and I persuaded her immediately to lie down when we got to Fauconberg
      Hall. She could not come down to dinner, which I had alone. The Princess
      Elizabeth came to me after it, with her majesty&rsquo;s permission that I
      might go to the play with my usual party; but I declined it, that I might
      make some tea for poor Miss Planta, as she had no maid, nor any creature
      to help her. The princess told me they were all going first upon the
      walks, to promener till the play time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat down to make my solitary tea, and had just sent up a basin to Miss
      Planta, when, to my equal surprise and pleasure, Mr. Fairly entered the
      room. &ldquo;I come now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to take my leave.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all, he added, gone to the walks, whither he must<span
      class="pagenum">202</span><a name="link202" id="link202"></a> in a few
      minutes follow them, and thence attend to the play, and the next morning,
      by five o&rsquo;clock, be ready for his post-chaise. Seeing me, however,
      already making tea, with his Usual and invariable sociability he said he
      would venture to stay and partake, though he was only come, he gravely
      repeated, to take his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I must not say,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;that I am sorry you are
      going, because I know so well you wish to be gone that it makes me wish it
      for you myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;you must not be sorry; when our
      friends are going to any joy. We must think of them, and be glad to part
      with them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Readily entering the same tone, with similar plainness of truth I
      answered, &ldquo;No, I will not be sorry you go, though miss you at
      Cheltenham I certainly must.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was his unreserved assent, &ldquo;you will miss me
      here, because I have spent my evenings with you; but you will not long
      remain at Cheltenham.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oime!&rdquo; thought I, you little think how much worse will be the
      quitting it. He owned that the bustle and fatigue of this life was too
      much both for his health and his spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him I Wished it might be a gratification to him, in his toils, to
      hear how the queen always spoke of him; With what evident and constant
      complacency and distinction. &ldquo;And you may credit her sincerity,&rdquo;
      I added, &ldquo;Since it is to so little a person as me she does this, and
      when no one else is present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not insensible to this, though he passed it over without much
      answer. He showed me a letter from his second son, very affectionate and
      natural. I congratulated him, most sincerely, on his approaching happiness
      in collecting them all together. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;my
      group will increase, like a snow-ball, as I roll along, and they will soon
      all four be as happy as four little things know how to be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This drew him on into some reflections upon affection and upon happiness.
      &ldquo;There is no happiness,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;without
      participation; no participation without affection. There is, indeed, in
      affection a charm that leaves all things behind it, and renders even every
      calamity that does not interfere with it inconsequential and there is no
      difficulty, no toil, no labour, no exertion, that will not be endured
      where there is a view of reaping it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He ruminated some time, and then told me of a sermon he had heard preached
      some months ago, sensibly demonstrating<span class="pagenum">203</span><a
      name="link203" id="link203"></a> the total vanity and insufficiency, even
      for this world, of all our best affections, and proving their fallibility
      from our most infirm humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      My concurrence did not here continue: I cannot hold this doctrine to be
      right, and I am most sure it is not desirable. Our best affections, I must
      and do believe, were given us for the best purposes, for every stimulation
      to good, and every solace in evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was not a time for argument. I said nothing, while he, melancholy
      and moralizing, continued in this style as long as he could venture to
      stay. He then rose and took his hat, saying, &ldquo;Well, so much for the
      day; what may come to-morrow I know not; but, be it what it may, I stand
      prepared.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I hoped, I told him, that his little snowball would be all he could wish
      it, and I was heartily glad he would so soon collect it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will say,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;nothing of any regrets,&rdquo;
      and bowed, and was hastening off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;we,&rdquo; however, had an openness and simplicity that drew
      from me an equally open and simple reply. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I cried,
      &ldquo;but I will say-for that you will have pleasure in hearing that you
      have lightened my time here in a manner that no one else could have done,
      of this party.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure this was rather a circumscribed compliment, those he left
      considered&mdash;but it was strict and exact truth, and therefore like his
      own dealing. He said not a word of answer, but bowed, and went away,
      leaving me firmly impressed with a belief that I shall find in him a true,
      an honourable, and even an affectionate friend, for life.

    <h2>
      MAJOR PRICE IS TIRED OF RETIREMENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sunday, Aug. 10.&mdash;Major Price was of the breakfast party this
      morning, to my great contentment. I heartily wish he was again in the king&rsquo;s
      household, he is so truly attached to his majesty, and he so earnestly
      himself wishes for a restoration, not to the equerryship, which is too
      laborious an office, but to any attendance upon the king&rsquo;s person of
      less fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened to me very much upon his situation and wishes. He has settled
      himself in a small farm near the house of his eldest brother, but I could
      see too plainly he has not found there the contentment that satisfies him.
      He sighs for society; he owns books are insufficient for everything, and
      his evenings<span class="pagenum">204</span><a name="link204" id="link204"></a>
      begin already to grow wearisome. He does not wish it to be talked of
      publicly, but he is solicitous to return to the king, in any place
      attached to his person, of but mild duty. Not only the king, he said, he
      loved, but all his society, and the way of life in general; and he had no
      tie whatsoever to Herefordshire that would make him hesitate a moment in
      quitting it, if another place could be made adequate to his fortune. His
      income was quite too small for any absence from his home of more than a
      few weeks, in its present plight; and therefore it could alone be by some
      post under government that he must flatter himself with ever returning to
      the scenes he had left.
    </p>
    <p>
      How rarely does a plan of retirement answer the expectations upon which it
      is raised! He fears having this suspected, and therefore keeps the matter
      to himself; but I believe he so much opened it to me, in the hope I might
      have an opportunity to make it known where it might be efficacious; for he
      told me, at the same time, he apprehended his majesty had a notion his
      fondness for Herefordshire, not his inability to continue equerry, had
      occasioned his resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall certainly make it my business to hint this to the queen. So
      faithful and attached a servant ought not to be thrown aside, and, after
      nine years&rsquo; service, left unrewarded, and seem considered as if
      superannuated.

    <h2>
      MR. FAIRLY&rsquo;S LITTLE NOTE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I came from her majesty, just before she went down to dinner, I was
      met by a servant who delivered me a letter, which he told me was just come
      by express. I took it in some alarm, fearing that ill news alone could
      bring it by such haste, but, before I could open it, he said, &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis
      from Mr. Fairly, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I hastened to read, and will now copy it:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Northleach, Aug. 10, 1788.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her majesty may possibly not have heard that Mr. Edmund Waller died
      on Thursday night. He was master of St. Catherine&rsquo;s, which is in her
      majesty&rsquo;s gift. It may be useful to her to have this early
      intelligence of this circumstance, and you will have the goodness to
      mention it to her. Mr. W. was at a house upon his own estate within a mile
      and a half of this place, Very truly and sincerely yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S. Fairly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney, Fauconberg Hall."<span class="pagenum">205</span><a
      name="link205" id="link205"></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      How to communicate this news, however, was a real distress to me. I know
      her majesty is rather scrupulous that all messages immediately to herself
      should be conveyed by the highest channels, and I feared she would think
      this ought to have been sent through her lady then in waiting, Lady
      Harcourt. Mr. Fairly, too, however superior to such small matters for
      himself, is most punctiliously attentive to them for her. I could
      attribute this only to haste. But my difficulty was not alone to have
      received the intelligence-the conclusion of the note I was sure would
      surprise her. The rest, as a message to herself, being without any
      beginning, would not strike her; but the words &ldquo;very truly and
      sincerely yours,&rdquo; come out with such an abrupt plainness, and to
      her, who knows not with what intimacy of intercourse we have lived
      together so much during this last month, I felt quite ashamed to show
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While wavering how to manage, a fortunate circumstance seemed to come to
      my relief; the Princess Elizabeth ran up hastily to her room, which is
      just opposite to mine, before she followed the queen down to dinner; I
      flew after her, and told her I had just heard of the death of Mr. Waller,
      the Master of St. Catherine&rsquo;s, and I begged her to communicate it to
      her majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She undertook it, with her usual readiness to oblige, and I was quite
      delighted to have been so speedy without producing my note, which I
      determined now not even to mention unless called upon, and even then not
      to produce; for now, as I should not have the first telling, it might
      easily be evaded by not having it in my pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment, however, that the dinner was over, Princess Elizabeth came to
      summon me to the queen. This was very unexpected, as I thought I should
      not see her till night; but I locked up my note and followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was only with the princesses. I found the place was of importance, by
      the interest she took about it. She asked me several questions relative to
      Mr. Waller. I answered her all I could collect from my note, for further
      never did I hear; but the moment I was obliged to stop she said, &ldquo;Pray
      have you known him long?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew him at all, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Why, then, how came you to receive the news about his death?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Was not this agreeable? I was forced to say, &ldquo;I heard of it only
      from Mr. Fairly, ma&rsquo;am."<span class="pagenum">206</span><a
      name="link206" id="link206"></a> Nothing could exceed the surprise with
      which she now lifted up her eyes to look at me. &ldquo;From Mr. Fairly?&mdash;Why
      did he not tell it me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      O, worse and worse! I was now compelled to answer, &ldquo;He did not know
      it when he was here, ma&rsquo;am; he heard it at Northleach, and, thinking
      it might be of use to your majesty to have the account immediately, he
      sent it over express.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A dead silence so uncomfortable ensued, that I thought it best presently
      to go on further, though unasked. &ldquo;Mr. Fairly, ma&rsquo;am, wrote
      the news to me, on such small paper, and in such haste, that it is hardly
      fit to be shown to your majesty; but I have the note upstairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer; again all silent; and then Princess Augusta said, &ldquo;Mamma,
      Miss Burney says she has the note upstairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your majesty pleases to see it&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up again, much more pleasantly, and said, &ldquo;I shall be
      glad to see it,&rdquo; with a little bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out I went for it, half regretting I had not burned it, to make the
      producing it impossible. When I brought it to her, she received it with
      the most gracious smile, and immediately read it aloud, with great
      complacency, till she came to the end and then, with a lowered and
      somewhat altered tone, the &ldquo;very truly and sincerely yours,&rdquo;
      which she seemed to look at for a moment with some doubt if it were not a
      mistake, but in returning it she bowed again, and simply said, &ldquo;I am
      very much obliged to Mr. Fairly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be sure how much I was pleased during this last week to hear that
      the place of the Master of St. Catherine&rsquo;s was given by her majesty
      to Mr. Fairly. It is reckoned the best in her gift, as a sinecure. What is
      the income I know not: reports differ from 400 to 500 per annum.

    <h2>
      THE RETURN TO WINDSOR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Saturday, Aug. 16.&mdash;We left Cheltenham early this morning. Major
      Price breakfasted with us, and was so melancholy at the king&rsquo;s
      departure he could hardly speak a word. All Cheltenham was drawn out into
      the High-street, the gentles on one side and the commons on the other, and
      a band, and &ldquo;God save the king,&rdquo; playing and singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Port, with all her friends, was there for a last look, and a
      sorrowful one we interchanged; Mr. Seward also, whom again I am not likely
      to meet for another two years at least.<span class="pagenum">207</span><a
      name="link207" id="link207"></a> The journey was quite without accident or
      adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus ends the Cheltenham episode. May I not justly call it so,
      different as it is to all the mode of life I have hitherto lived here, or
      alas I am in a way to live henceforward?
    </p>
    <p>
      Melancholy&mdash;most melancholy&mdash;was the return to Windsor destitute
      of all that could solace, compose, or delight; replete with whatever could
      fatigue, harass, and depress! Ease, leisure, elegant society, and
      interesting communication, were now to give place to arrogant manners,
      contentious disputation, and arbitrary ignorance! Oh, heaven! my dearest
      friends, what scales could have held and have weighed the heart of your
      F.B. as she drove past the door of her revered, lost comforter, to enter
      the apartment inhabited by such qualities!
    </p>
    <p>
      But before I quit this journey let me tell one very pleasant anecdote.
      When we stopped to change horses at Burford I alighted and went into the
      inn, to meet Mrs. Gast, to whom I had sent by Mrs. Frodsham a request to
      be there as we passed through the town. I rejoiced indeed to see again the
      sister of our first and wisest friend. My Susanna, who knows her too
      enthusiastic character, will easily suppose my reception. I was folded in
      her arms, and bathed in her tears all my little stay, and my own, from
      reflected tenderness for her ever-honoured, loved, and lamented brother,
      would not be kept quite back; &rsquo;twas a species of sorrowful joy&mdash;painful,
      yet pleasing&mdash;that seemed like a fresh tribute to his memory and my
      affection, and made the meeting excite an emotion that occupied my mind
      and reflections almost all the rest of my journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      She inquired most kindly after my dear father and my Susanna, and
      separately and with interest of all the rest of the family; but her
      surprise to see me now, by this most un expected journey, when she had
      concluded me inevitably shut up from her sight for the remainder of her
      life, joined to the natural warmth of her disposition, seemed almost to
      suffocate her. I was very sorry to leave her, but my time was unavoidably
      short and hurried. I inquired after Chesington, and heard very good
      accounts.

    <h2>
      AT WINDSOR AGAIN THE CANON AND MRS. SCHWELLENBERG.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Windsor, Sunday, Aug. 17.&mdash;This day, after our arrival, began
      precisely the same as every day preceding our journey. The Sleeping Beauty
      in the Wood could not awake more completely to the same scene; yet I
      neither have been asleep, nor <span class="pagenum">208</span><a
      name="link208" id="link208"></a> am quite a beauty! O! I wish I were as
      near to the latter as the former at this minute!
    </p>
    <p>
      We had all the set assembled to congratulate his majesty on his return&mdash;generals
      and colonels without end. I was very glad while the large party lasted,
      its diminution into a solitary pair ending in worse than piquet&mdash;a
      tête-à-tête!&mdash;and such a one, too! after being so spoiled!
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday, Aug. 18.&mdash;Well, now I have a new personage to introduce to
      you, and no small one; ask else the stars, moon and planets! While I was
      surrounded with bandboxes, and unpacking, Dr. Shepherd was announced.
      Eager to make his compliments on the safe return, he forced a passage
      through the back avenues and stairs, for he told me he did not like being
      seen coming to me at the front door, as it might create some jealousies
      amongst the other canons! A very commendable circumspection! but whether
      for my sake or his own he did not particularize.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Lalande, he said, the famous astronomer,<a href="#linknote-290"
      name="linknoteref-290" id="linknoteref-290"><small>290</small></a> was
      just arrived in England, and now at Windsor, and he had expressed a desire
      to be introduced to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, while he was talking this over, and I was wondering and evading,
      entered Mr. Turbulent. What a surprise at sight of the reverend canon! The
      reverend canon, also, was interrupted and confused, fearing, possibly, the
      high honour he did me might now transpire amongst his brethren,
      notwithstanding his generous efforts to spare them its knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Turbulent, who looked big with heroics, was quite provoked to see he
      had no chance of giving them vent. They each outstayed the patience of the
      other, and at last both went off together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hours after, however, while I was dressing, the canon returned. I
      could not admit him, and bid Goter tell him at the door I was not visible.
      He desired he might wait till I was ready, as he had business of
      importance. I would not let him into the next room, but said he might stay
      in the eating-parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was dressed I sent Goter to bring him in. She came back, grinning
      and colouring; she had not found him, she said, but only Mrs.
      Schwellenberg, who was there alone, and had<span class="pagenum">209</span><a
      name="link209" id="link209"></a> called her in to know what she wanted.
      She answered she came to seek for a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no gentleman,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;to come into
      my parlour. It is not permit. When he comes I will have it locked up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      O, ho, my poor careful canon! thought I. However, soon after a tap again
      at my door introduced him. He said he had been waiting below in the
      passage, as he saw Madame Schwellenberg in the parlour, and did not care
      to have her know him; but his business was to settle bringing M. de
      Lalande to see me in the evening. I told him I was much honoured, and so
      forth, but that I received no evening company, as I was officially
      engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had made the appointment, he said, and could not break it without
      affronting him; besides, he gave me to understand it would be an honour to
      me for ever to be visited by so great an astronomer. I agreed as to that,
      and was forced, moreover, to agree to all the rest, no resource remaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mentioned to her majesty the state of the case. She thought the canon
      very officious, and disapproved the arrangement, but saw it was
      unavoidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the dinner came I was asked by the présidente, &ldquo;What for
      send you gentlemen to my parlour?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was dressing, ma&rsquo;am, and could not possibly receive company
      in mine, and thought the other empty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Empty or full is the same! I won&rsquo;t have it. I will lock up
      the room when it is done so. No, no, I won&rsquo;t have no gentlemen here;
      it is not permit, perticklere when they von&rsquo;t not speak to me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I then heard that &ldquo;a large man, what you call,&rdquo; had entered
      that sacred domain, and seeing there a lady, had quitted it &ldquo;bob
      short!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I immediately explained all that had passed, for I had no other way to
      save myself from an imputation of favouring the visits and indiscretion of
      this most gallant canon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, when he comes so often he might like you. For what won&rsquo;t
      you not marry him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was coming to the point, and so seriously, I found myself obliged to
      be serious in answer, to avoid misconstruction, and to assure her, that
      were he Archbishop of Canterbury, and actually at my feet, I would not
      become archbishopess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, you been right when you don&rsquo;t not like him; I don&rsquo;t
      not like the men neither: not one from them!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">210</span><a
      name="link210" id="link210"></a> So this settled us very amicably till
      tea-time, and in the midst of that, with a room full of people, I was
      called out by Westerhaults to Dr. Shepherd!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schwellenberg herself actually te-he&rsquo;d at this, and I could not
      possibly help laughing myself, but I hurried into the next room, where I
      found him with his friend, M. de Lalande. What a reception awaited me! how
      unexpected a one from a famed and great astronomer.

    <h2>
      COMPLIMENTS FROM A FAMOUS FOREIGN ASTRONOMER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      M. de Lalande advanced to meet me&mdash;-I will not be quite positive it
      was on tiptoe, but certainly with a mixture of jerk and strut that could
      not be quite flat-footed. He kissed my hand with the air of a
      petit-maître, and then broke forth into such an harangue of éloges, so
      solemn with regard to its own weight and importance, and so fade<a
      href="#linknote-291" name="linknoteref-291" id="linknoteref-291"><small>291</small></a>
      with respect to the little personage addressed, that I could not help
      thinking it lucky for the planets, stars, and sun, they were not bound to
      hear his comments, though obliged to undergo his calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my part sundry profound reverences, with now and then an &ldquo;O,
      monsieur!&rdquo; or &ldquo;c&rsquo;est trop d&rsquo;honneur,&rdquo;
      acquitted me so well, that the first harangue being finished, on the score
      of general and grand reputation, éloge the second began, on the excellency
      with which &ldquo;cette célèbre demoiselle&rdquo; spoke French!
    </p>
    <p>
      This may surprise you, my dear friends; but You must consider M. de
      Lalande is a great discoverer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, but had you seen Dr. Shepherd! he looked lost in sleek delight and
      wonder, that a person to whom he had introduced M. de Lalande should be an
      object for such fine speeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gentleman&rsquo;s figure, meanwhile, corresponds no better with his
      discourse than his scientific profession, for he is an ugly little
      wrinkled old man, with a fine showy waistcoat, rich lace ruffles, and the
      grimaces of a dentist. I believe he chose to display that a Frenchman of
      science could be also a man of gallantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was seated between them, but the good doctor made no greater
      interruption to the florid professor than I did myself; he only grinned
      applause, with placid, but ineffable satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing therefore intervening, éloge the third followed, after a pause no
      longer than might be necessary for due admiration<span class="pagenum">211</span><a
      name="link211" id="link211"></a> of éloge the second. This had for sujet
      the fair female sex; how the ladies were now all improved; how they could
      write, and read, and spell; how a man now-a-days might talk with them and
      be understood, and how delightful it was to see such pretty creatures
      turned rational!
    </p>
    <p>
      And all this, of course, interspersed with particular observations and
      most pointed applications; nor was there in the whole string of
      compliments which made up the three bouquets, one single one amongst them
      that might have disgraced any petit maître to utter, or any petite
      maîtresse to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third being ended, a rather longer pause ensued. I believe he was dry,
      but I offered him no tea. I would not voluntarily be accessory to
      detaining such great personages from higher avocations. I wished him next
      to go and study the stars: from the moon he seemed so lately arrived there
      was little occasion for another journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      I flatter myself he was of the same opinion, for the fourth éloge was all
      upon his unhappiness in tearing himself away from so much merit, and ended
      in as many bows as had accompanied his entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose, in going, he said, with a shrug, to the canon, &ldquo;M. le
      docteur, c&rsquo;est bien gênant, mais il faut dire des jolies choses aux
      dames!&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-293" name="linknoteref-293"
      id="linknoteref-293"><small>293</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      He was going the next day to see Dr. Maskelyne&rsquo;s observatory. Well!
      I have had him first in mine!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged on my return to the tea-room to undergo much dull raillery
      from my fair companion, and Much of wonder that &ldquo;since the canon had
      such good preferment&rdquo; I did not &ldquo;marry him at once,&rdquo; for
      he &ldquo;would not come so often if he did not want it.&rdquo;

      THE PRINCE EYES MISS BURNEY CURIOUSLY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tuesday, Aug. 18.&mdash;-The Duke of York&rsquo;s birthday was kept this
      day, instead of Saturday, that Sunday morning might not interfere with the
      ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince of Wales arrived early, while I was yet with the queen. He
      kissed her hand, and she sent for the princesses. Only Princess Elizabeth
      and Princess Sophia were dressed. Her majesty went into the next room with
      Mrs. Sandys, to have her shoes put on, with which she always finishes. The
      prince and princesses then chatted away most fluently. <span
      class="pagenum">212</span><a name="link212" id="link212"></a> Princess
      Elizabeth frequently addressed me with great sweetness but the prince only
      with curious eyes. Do not, however, understand that his looks were either
      haughty or impertinent far from it; they were curious, however, in the
      extreme.

    <h2>
      COLONEL MANNERS&rsquo;S BEATING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Colonel Manners made me laugh as If I had been at a farce, by his history
      of the late Westminster election, in which Lord John Townshend conquered
      Lord Hood. Colonel Manners is a most eager and active partisan on the side
      of the government, but so indiscreet, that he almost regularly gets his
      head broke at every contested election; and he relates it as a thing of
      course. I inquired if he pursued his musical studies, so happily begun
      with Colonel Wellbred? &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;not much,
      because of the election; but the thing is, to get an ear: however, I think
      I have got one, because I know a tune when I hear it, if it&rsquo;s one
      that I&rsquo;ve heard before a good many times so I think that&rsquo;s a
      proof; but I can never get asked to a concert, and that keeps me a little
      behind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;your friends conclude you have
      music enough in your three months&rsquo; waiting to satisfy you for all
      the year?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, ma&rsquo;am, as to that, I&rsquo;d just as lief hear so many
      pots and pans rattled together; one noise is just as well as another to
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him whether his electioneering with so much activity did not make
      his mother, Lady Robert, a little uneasy?&mdash;N.B. She is a methodist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, it does her a great deal of good,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;for I
      could never get her to meddle before; but when I&rsquo;d had my head
      broke, it provoked her so, she went about herself canvassing among the
      good people,&mdash;and she got us twenty votes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So then,&rdquo; cried Colonel Goldsworthy, &ldquo;there are twenty
      good people in the world? That&rsquo;s your calculation, is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fisher, who just then came in, and knew nothing of what had passed,
      starting the election, said to Colonel Manners, &ldquo;So, sir, you have
      been beat, I hear!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He meant only his party; but his person having shared the same fate,
      occasioned a violent shout among the rest at this innocent speech, and its
      innocent answer for Colonel Manners, <span class="pagenum">213</span><a
      name="link213" id="link213"></a> looking only a little surprised, simply
      said, &ldquo;Yes, I was beat, a little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little, sir?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Fisher, &ldquo;no, a great deal
      you were shamefully beat&mdash;thrashed thoroughly.&rdquo; In the midst of
      a violent second shout, Colonel Manners only said, &ldquo;Well, I always
      hated all that party, and now I hate them worse than ever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that I&rsquo;ll be bound for you,&rdquo; cried Colonel
      Goldsworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes for having been so drubbed by them,&rdquo; cried Mr. Fisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I now, through all his good humour, saw Colonel Manners colour a
      little, I said in a low voice to Mr. Fisher, &ldquo;Pray is it in
      innocence, or in malice, that you use these terms.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw his innocence by his surprise, and I whispered him the literal state
      of all he said; he was quite shocked, and coloured in his turn,
      apologising instantly to Colonel Manners, and protesting he had never
      heard of his personal ill usage, but only meant the defeat of his party.

    <h2>
      MR. FAIRLY IS DISCUSSED BY HIS BROTHER EQUERRIES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Everybody was full of Mr. Fairly&rsquo;s appointment, and spoke of it with
      pleasure. General Budé had seen him in town, where he had remained some
      days, to take the oaths, I believe, necessary for his place. General Budé
      has long been intimate with him, and spoke of his character exactly as it
      has appeared to me; and Colonel Goldsworthy, who was at Westminster with
      him, declared he believed a better man did not exist. &ldquo;This, in
      particular,&rdquo; cried General Budé, &ldquo;I must say of Fairly:
      whatever he thinks right he pursues straightforward and I believe there is
      not a sacrifice upon earth that he would not make, rather than turn a
      moment out of the path that he had an opinion it was his duty to keep in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked a good deal of his late lady; none of them knew her but very
      slightly, as she was remarkably reserved. &ldquo;More than reserved,&rdquo;
      cried General Budé, &ldquo;she was quite cold. Yet she loved London and
      public life, and Fairly never had any taste for them; in that they were
      very mal assortis, but in all other things very happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Colonel Goldsworthy, &ldquo;and how shall we give
      praise enough to a man that would be happy himself, and make<span
      class="pagenum">214</span><a name="link214" id="link214"></a> his wife so
      too, for all that difference of opinion? for it was all his management,
      and good address, and good temper. I hardly know such another man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      General Budé then related many circumstances of his most exemplary conduct
      during the illness of his poor suffering wife, and after her loss;
      everybody, indeed, upon the occasion of this new appointment, has broke
      forth to do justice to his deserving it. Mrs. Ariana Egerton, who came
      twice to drink tea with me on my being sensa Cerbera, told me that her
      brother-in-law, Colonel Masters, who had served with him at Gibraltar,
      protested there was not an officer in the army of a nobler and higher
      character, both professional and personal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked me a thousand questions of what I thought about Miss Fuzilier?
      She dislikes her so very much, she cannot bear to think of her becoming
      Mrs. Fairly. She has met with some marks of contempt from her in their
      official meetings at St. James&rsquo;s, that cannot be pardoned. Miss
      Fuziller, indeed, seemed to me formerly, when I used to meet her in
      company, to have an uncertainty of disposition that made her like two
      persons; now haughty, silent, and supercilious&mdash;and then gentle,
      composed, and interesting. She Is, however, very little liked, the worst
      being always what most spreads abroad.

    <h2>
      BARON TRENCK: MR. TURBULENT&rsquo;S RAILLERY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sept. 1.&mdash;Peace to the manes of the poor slaughtered partridges!
    </p>
    <p>
      I finished this morning the &ldquo;Memoirs of Baron Trenck,&rdquo; which
      have given me a great deal of entertainment; I mean in the first volume,
      the second containing not more matter than might fill four pages. But the
      singular hardiness, gallantry, ferocity, and ingenuity of this copy of the
      knights of ancient times, who has happened to be born since his proper
      epoch, have wonderfully drawn me on, and I could not rest without
      finishing his adventures. They are reported to be chiefly of his own
      invention; but I really find an air of self-belief in his relations, that
      inclines me to think he has but narrated what he had persuaded himself was
      true. His ill-usage is such as to raise the utmost indignation in every
      reader and if it really affected his memory and imagination, and became
      thence the parent of some few embellishments and episodes, I can neither
      wonder nor feel the interest of his narrative diminished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sept. 2.&mdash;Mr. Turbulent was in high rage that I was utterly<span
      class="pagenum">215</span><a name="link215" id="link215"></a> invisible
      since my return from Cheltenham; he protested he had called seven times at
      my door without gaining admission, and never was able to get in but when
      Dr. Shepherd had led the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He next began a mysterious attack upon the proceedings of Cheltenham. He
      had heard, he said, strange stories of flirtations there. I could not
      doubt what he meant, but I would not seem to understand him: first,
      because I know not from whom he has been picking up this food for his busy
      spirit, since no one there appeared collecting it for him; and secondly,
      because I would not degrade an acquaintance which I must hope will prove
      as permanent as it is honourable, by conceiving the word flirtation to be
      possibly connected with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      By every opportunity, in the course of the day, he renewed this obscure
      raillery; but I never would second it, either by question or retort, and
      therefore it cannot but die away unmeaningly as it was born. Some effect,
      however, it seems to have had upon him, who has withdrawn all his own
      heroics, while endeavouring to develop what I have received elsewhere.

      AMIABLE MRS. SCHWELLENBERG AGAIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sept. 4.&mdash;To-day there was a Drawing-room, and I had the blessing of
      my dearest father while it lasted; but not solus; he was accompanied by my
      mother; and my dear Esther and her little innocent Sophy spent part of the
      time with us. I am to be god-mother to the two little ones, Esther&rsquo;s
      and James&rsquo;s. Heaven bless them!
    </p>
    <p>
      We returned to Kew to a late dinner; and, indeed, I had one of the
      severest evenings I ever passed, where my heart took no share in
      unkindness and injustice. I was wearied in the extreme, as I always am on
      these drawing-room days, which begin with full hair-dressing at six o&rsquo;clock
      in the morning, and hardly ever allow any breakfast time, and certainly
      only standing, except while frizzing, till the drawing-room commences; and
      then two journeys in that decked condition&mdash;and then another
      dressing, with three dressing attendances&mdash;and a dinner at near seven
      o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, not having power to be very amusing after all this, I was sternly
      asked by Mrs. Schwellenberg, &ldquo;For what I did not talk?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I answered simply, &ldquo;Because I was tired.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tired!&mdash;what have you done? when I used to do so much more&mdash;you
      tired! what have you to do but to be happy:<span class="pagenum">216</span><a
      name="link216" id="link216"></a>&mdash;have you the laces to buy? have you
      the wardrobe to part? have you&mdash;you tired? Vell, what will become
      next, when you have every happiness!&mdash;you might not be tired. No, I
      can&rsquo;t bear It.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This, and so much more than it would be possible to write, all uttered
      with a haughtiness and contempt that the lowest servant could not have
      brooked receiving, awoke me pretty completely, though before I was scarce
      able to keep my eyelids a moment open; but so sick I turned, that indeed
      it was neither patience nor effort that enabled me to hear her; I had
      literally hardly strength, mental or bodily, to have answered her. Every
      happiness mine!&mdash;O gracious heaven! thought I, and is this the
      companion of my leisure&mdash;the associate of my life! Ah, my dear
      friends, I will not now go on&mdash;I turn sick again.

    <h2>
      COLONEL GOLDSWORTHY&rsquo;S BREACH OF ETIQUETTE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schwellenberg has become both colder and fiercer. I cannot now even
      meet her eyes-they are almost terrifying. Nothing upon earth having passed
      between us, nor the most remote subject of offence having occurred, I have
      only one thing on which to rest my conjectures, for the cause of this
      newly-awakened evil spirit, and this is from the gentlemen. They had all
      of late been so wearied that they could not submit even for a quarter of
      an hour to her society: they had swallowed a dish of tea and quitted the
      room all in five minutes, and Colonel Goldsworthy in particular, when
      without any companion in his waiting, had actually always fallen asleep,<span
      class="pagenum">217</span><a name="link217" id="link217"></a> even during
      that short interval, or at least shut his eyes, to save himself the toil
      of speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      This she brooked very ill, but I was esteemed innocent, and therefore
      made, occasionally, the confidant of her complaints. But lately, that she
      has been ill, and kept upstairs every night, she has always desired me to
      come to her as soon as tea was over, which, she observed, &ldquo;need not
      keep me five minutes.&rdquo; On the contrary, however, the tea is now at
      least an hour, and often more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been constantly received with reproaches for not coming sooner, and
      compelled to declare I had not been sooner at liberty. This has occasioned
      a deep and visible resentment, all against them, yet vented upon me, not
      in acknowledged displeasure&mdash;pride there interfered&mdash;but in
      constant ill-humour, ill-breeding, and ill-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, however, she has broken out into one inquiry, which, if
      favourably answered, might have appeased all; but truth was too strongly
      in the way. A few evenings after her confinement she very gravely said,
      &ldquo;Colonel Goldsworthy always sleeps with me! sleeps he with you the
      same?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of all my irksome discomfort, it was with difficulty I could
      keep my countenance at this question, which I was forced to negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening she repeated it. &ldquo;Vell, sleeps he yet with you&mdash;Colonel
      Goldsworthy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I hesitatingly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! ver vell! he will sleep with nobody but me! O, i von&rsquo;t
      come down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And a little after she added, &ldquo;I believe he vill marry you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe not, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, very gravely, she proposed him to me, saying he only wanted a
      little encouragement, for he was always declaring he wished for a wife,
      and yet wanted no fortune&mdash;&ldquo;so for what won&rsquo;t you not
      have him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I assured her we were both perfectly well satisfied apart, and equally
      free from any thoughts of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then for what,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you have Dr.
      Shepherd?&rdquo; She Is now in the utmost haste to dispose of me! And then
      she added she had been told that Dr. Shepherd would marry me!
    </p>
    <p>
      She is an amazing woman! Alas, I might have told her I knew too well what
      it was to be tied to a companion ill-assorted and unbeloved, where I could
      not help myself, to<span class="pagenum">218</span><a name="link218"
      id="link218"></a> make any such experiment as a volunteer!
    </p>
    <p>
      If she asks me any more about Colonel Goldsworthy and his sleeping, I
      think I will answer I am too near-sighted to be sure if he is awake or
      not!
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I cannot but take this stroke concerning the table extremely ill;
      for though amongst things of the very least consequence in itself, it is
      more openly designed as an affront than any step that has been taken with
      me yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have given the colonel a hint, however,-that he may keep awake in
      future....

      Oct. 2.&mdash;Mrs. Schwellenberg, very ill indeed, took leave of the queen

      Hastings. I was really very sorry for her; she was truly in a situation Of
      suffering, from bodily pain, the most pitiable. I thought, as I looked at
      her, that if the ill-humours I so often experience could relieve her, I
      would consent to bear them unrepining, in preference to seeing or knowing
      her so ill. But it is just the contrary; spleen and ill-temper only
      aggravate disease, and while they involve others in temporary
      participation of their misery, twine it around themselves in bandages
      almost stationary. She was civil, too, poor woman. I suppose when absent

      round to good-humour; and even General Grenville begins to grow sociable.
      He has quitted the corner into which he used to cast his long figure,
      merely to yawn and lounge; and though yawn and lounge he does still, and
      must, I believe, to the end of the chapter, he yet does it in society, and
      mixes between it loud sudden laughter at what is occasionally said, and
      even here and there a question relative to what is going forward.
      Nay-yesterday he even seated himself at the tea<span class="pagenum">219</span><a
      name="link219" id="link219"></a> table, and amused himself by playing with
      my work-box, and making sundry inquiries about its contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oct. 10.&mdash;This evening, most unwittingly, I put my new neighbour&rsquo;s
      good-humour somewhat to the test. He asked me whether I had walked out in
      the morning? Yes, I answered, I always walked. &ldquo;And in the Little
      park?&rdquo; cried he. Yes, I said, and to Old Windsor, and round the park
      wall, and along the banks of the Thames, and almost to Beaumont Lodge, and
      in the avenue of the Great park, and in short, in all the vicinage of
      Windsor. &ldquo;But in the Little park?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still I did not understand him, but plainly answered, &ldquo;Yes, this
      morning; and indeed many mornings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But did you see nothing&mdash;remark nothing there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that I recollect, except some soldiers drilling.&rdquo; You
      never heard such a laugh as now broke forth from all for, alas for my poor
      eyes, there had been in the Little park General Grenville&rsquo;s whole
      regiment, with all his officers, and himself at their head! Fortunately it
      is reckoned one of the finest in the king&rsquo;s service: this I
      mentioned, adding that else I could never again appear before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He affected to be vehemently affronted, but hardly knew how, even in joke,
      to appear so; and all the rest helped the matter on, by saying that they
      should know now how to distinguish his regiment, which henceforth must
      always be called &ldquo;the drill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is, as soon as I perceived a few red-coats I had turned another
      way, to avoid being marched at, and therefore their number and splendour
      had all been thrown away upon me. <span class="pagenum">220</span><a

    <h2>
      SECTION 14 (1788-9.) THE KING&rsquo;S ILLNESS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Fanny&rsquo;s vivid account of the king&rsquo;s illness, from the autumn
      of 1788 to the spring of 1789, needs no recommendation to the reader. It
      requires only to be supplemented by a very brief sketch of the consequent
      proceedings in Parliament, which excited so much foolish indignation in
      the royal household, and in Fanny herself. That she should display more
      feeling than judgment under circumstances so affecting, was, perhaps, only
      to be expected, but it is none the less evident, from certain passages in
      the Diary, that the tainted Court atmosphere had already clouded, to some
      extent, her naturally clear understanding. The insanity of a sovereign is,
      to her, a purely private and personal matter, with respect to which the
      only business of the public is to offer up prayers for his majesty&rsquo;s
      speedy recovery. That ministers should take steps to provide for the
      performance of the royal functions in government, during the period of the
      king&rsquo;s incapacity, is an act of effrontery at which she wants words
      to express her indignation. Mrs. Schwellenberg, who thought it treason to
      say that the King was ever at all indisposed, was scarcely more
      unreasonable in this particular than Miss Fanny Burney, who shuddered,
      with sentimental horror, at the mention of a Regency Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the commencement of November, 1788, there was no longer any doubt as
      to the serious nature of the king&rsquo;s malady. At the meeting of
      Parliament the prime minister, Mr. Pitt, Moved that a committee be
      appointed to examine the physicians attendant upon his majesty. This
      motion was agreed to, and on the 10th of December the report of the
      committee was laid upon the table of the House. The physicians agreed that
      his Majesty was then totally incapable of attending to public business.
      They agreed also in holding Out strong hopes of his ultimate recovery, but
      none of them would venture to give any opinion as to the probable duration
      of his derangement. Upon this, Mr. Pitt<span class="pagenum">221</span><a
      name="link221" id="link221"></a> moved for a committee to examine and
      report upon such precedents as might be found of proceedings in cases of
      the interruption, from any cause, of the personal exercise of the royal
      authority. The motion was strenuously resisted by the opposition, headed
      by Mr. Fox, who argued that whenever the sovereign was incapacitated from
      performing the functions of his office, the heir-apparent, if of full age
      and capacity, had an inalienable right to act as his substitute. This
      doctrine seems certainly inconsistent with the liberal principles
      professed by the opposition, but it will be remembered that at this time
      the Prince of Wales was politically in alliance with that party, and that
      he was on terms of friendship with Mr. Fox himself. On the other hand,
      Pitt protested that in such circumstances the heir-apparent had no more
      claim to exercise, as a matter of right, the royal functions, than any
      other Subject of the crown; and that it belonged only to the two Houses of
      Parliament to make such provision for supplying the deficiency in the
      government as they should think proper. As to the person of the Regent
      there was no dispute; the question was, simply, whether the Prince of
      Wales should assume the Regency in his own right, or by the authority of
      Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitt&rsquo;s motion being carried, the committee was accordingly
      appointed, and proceeded at once to make their examination and report. The
      prime minister then (December 16) moved two resolutions, declaring,
      firstly, that the king was incapable of performing the functions of his
      office, and, secondly, that it was the duty of Parliament to provide for
      the exercise of those functions. In spite of Fox&rsquo;s opposition both
      resolutions were carried, and a third resolution was moved by Pitt, and
      passed (December 23), empowering the lord chancellor to affix the great
      seal to the intended Regency Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in January, 1789, a fresh examination of the physicians was voted,
      but gave no more definite hopes of an early recovery. Pitt now wrote to
      the Prince of Wales, informing him of the plan intended to be pursued:
      that the prince should be invested with the authority of Regent, under
      certain restrictions, regarding especially the granting of peerages,
      offices, or pensions; and that the care of the king&rsquo;s person and the
      control of the royal household should remain with the queen. The prince,
      in reply, expressed his readiness to accept the Regency, while protesting
      strongly against the proposed limitations of his authority; and on the
      16th of January, a bill, in which the prime ministers scheme was embodied,
      was introduced into the House. The question was actively debated in both
      Houses, until, in the latter part of February, the king&rsquo;s recovery
      put a stop to further proceedings.-ED.]<span class="pagenum">222</span><a

    <h2>
      UNCERTAIN STATE OF THE KING&rsquo;S HEALTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kew, Friday, Oct. 17.&mdash;Our return to Windsor is postponed till
      to-morrow. The king is not well; he has not been quite well some time, yet
      nothing I hope alarming, though there is an uncertainty as to his
      complaint not very satisfactory; so precious, too, is his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oct. 18.&mdash;The king was this morning better. My royal mistress told me
      Sir George Baker<a href="#linknote-294" name="linknoteref-294"
      id="linknoteref-294"><small>294</small></a> was to settle whether we
      returned to Windsor to-day or to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday, Oct. 19.&mdash;The Windsor journey is again postponed, and the
      king is but very indifferent. Heaven preserve him! there is something
      unspeakably alarming in his smallest indisposition. I am very much with
      the queen, who, I see, is very uneasy, but she talks not of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are to stay here some time longer, and so unprepared were we for more
      than a day or two, that our distresses are prodigious, even for clothes to
      wear; and as to books, there are not three amongst us; and for company
      only Mr. de Luc and Miss Planta; and so, in mere desperation for
      employment, I have just begun a tragedy.<a href="#linknote-295"
      name="linknoteref-295" id="linknoteref-295"><small>295</small></a> We are
      now in so spiritless a situation that my mind would bend to nothing less
      sad, even in fiction. But I am very glad something of this kind has
      occurred to me; it may while away the tediousness of this unsettled,
      unoccupied, unpleasant period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oct. 20.&mdash;The king was taken very ill in the night, and we have all
      been cruelly frightened&mdash;but it went off, and, thank heaven! he is
      now better.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had all my morning devoted to receiving inquiring visits. Lady
      Effingham, Sir George Howard, Lady Frances Howard, all came from Stoke to
      obtain news of the king; his least illness spreads in a moment. Lady
      Frances Douglas came also. She is wife of the Archibald Douglas who caused
      the famous Hamilton trial in the House of Peers, for his claim to the
      Douglas name.<a href="#linknote-296" name="linknoteref-296"
      id="linknoteref-296"><small>296</small></a> She is fat, and dunch, and
      heavy, and ugly; otherwise, they say, agreeable enough.<span
      class="pagenum">223</span><a name="link223" id="link223"></a> Mr.
      Turbulent has been sent for, and he enlivens the scene somewhat. He is now
      all he should be, and so altered! scarce a flight left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oct. 21.&mdash;The good and excellent king is again better, and we expect
      to remove to Windsor in a day or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oct. 23.&mdash;The king continues to mend, thank God! Saturday we hope to
      return to Windsor. Had not this composition fit seized me, societyless,
      and bookless, and viewless as I am, I know not how I could have whiled
      away my being; but my tragedy goes on, and fills up all vacancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oct. 25.&mdash;Yesterday was so much the same, I have not marked it; not
      so to-day. The king was so much better that our Windsor journey at length
      took place, with permission of Sir George Baker, the only physician his
      majesty will admit. Miss Cambridge was with me to the last moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been hanging up a darling remembrance of my revered, incomparable
      Mrs. Delany. Her &ldquo;Sacharissa&rdquo; is now over my chimney. I could
      not at first bear it, but now I look at it, and call her back to my eye&rsquo;s
      mind perpetually. This, like the tragedy I have set about, suits the turn
      of things in this habitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a sort of conference with his Majesty, or rather I was the object to
      whom he spoke, with a manner so uncommon, that a high fever alone could
      account for it, a rapidity, a hoarseness of voice, a volubility, an
      earnestness&mdash;a vehemence, rather&mdash;it startled me inexpressibly;
      yet with a graciousness exceeding even all I ever met with before&mdash;it
      was almost kindness!
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaven&mdash;Heaven preserve him! The queen grows more<span class="pagenum">224</span><a
      name="link224" id="link224"></a> and more uneasy. She alarms me sometimes
      for herself, at other times she has a sedateness that wonders me still
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday, Oct. 26-The king was prevailed upon not to go to chapel this
      morning. I met him in the passage from the queen&rsquo;s room; he stopped
      me, and conversed upon his health near half-an-hour, still with that
      extreme quickness of Speech and manner that belongs to fever; and he
      hardly sleeps, he tells me, one minute all night; indeed, if he recovers
      not his rest, a most delirious fever seems to threaten him. He is all
      agitation, all emotion, yet all benevolence and goodness, even to a degree
      that makes it touching to hear him speak. He assures everybody of his
      health; he seems only fearful to give uneasiness to others, yet certainly
      he is better than last night. Nobody speaks of his illness, nor what they
      think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oct. 29.&mdash;The dear and good king again gains ground, and the queen
      becomes easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day Miss Planta told me she heard Mr. Fairly was confined at Sir R&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s, and therefore she would now lay any wager
      he was to marry Miss F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.<a href="#linknote-297"
      name="linknoteref-297" id="linknoteref-297"><small>297</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening I inquired what news of him of General Budé: he told me he
      was still confined at a friend&rsquo;s house, but avoided naming where&mdash;probably
      from suggesting that, however little truth there may yet have been in the
      report, more may belong to it from this particular intercourse.

    <h2>
      THE KING COMPLAINS OF WANT OF SLEEP.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nov. 1.&mdash;Our king does not advance in amendment; he grows so weak
      that he walks like a gouty man, yet has such spirits that he has talked
      away his voice, and is so hoarse it is painful to hear him. The queen is
      evidently in great uneasiness. God send him better!
    </p>
    <p>
      She read to me to-day a lecture of Hunter&rsquo;s. During the reading,
      twice, at pathetic passages, my poor queen shed tears. &ldquo;How nervous
      I am?&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;I am quite a fool! Don&rsquo;t you think
      so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; was all I dared answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She revived, however, finished the lecture, and went upstairs and played
      upon the Princess Augusta&rsquo;s harpsichord.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was hunting. Her anxiety for his return was<span class="pagenum">225</span><a
      name="link225" id="link225"></a> greater than ever. The moment he arrived
      he sent a page to desire to have coffee and take his bark in the queen&rsquo;s
      dressing-room. She said she would pour it out herself, and sent to inquire
      how he drank it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king is very sensible of the great change there is in himself, and of
      her disturbance at it. It seems, but heaven avert it! a threat of a total
      breaking up of the constitution. This, too, seems his own idea. I was
      present at his first seeing Lady Effingham on his return to Windsor this
      last time. &ldquo;My dear Effy,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you see me, all at
      once, an old man.&rdquo; I was so much affected by this exclamation, that
      I wished to run out of the room. Yet I could not but recover when Lady
      Effingham, in her well-meaning but literal way, composedly answered,
      &ldquo;We must all grow old, sir,&mdash;I am sure I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He then produced a walking-stick which he had just ordered. &ldquo;He
      could not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;get on without it; his strength seemed
      diminishing hourly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the bark, he said, &ldquo;But the queen,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;is
      my physician, and no man need have a better; she is my friend, and no man
      can have a better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How the queen commanded herself I cannot conceive; but there was something
      so touching in this speech, from his hoarse voice and altered countenance,
      that it overset me very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor can I ever forget him in what passed this night. When I came to the
      queen&rsquo;s dressing-room he was still with her. He constantly conducts
      her to it before he retires to his own. He was begging her not to speak to
      him when he got to his room, that he might fall asleep, as he felt great
      want of that refreshment. He repeated this desire, I believe, at least a
      hundred times, though, far enough from need Ing it, the poor queen never
      uttered one syllable! He then applied to me, saying he was really very
      well, except in that one particular, that he could not sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kindness and benevolence of his manner all this time was most
      penetrating: he seemed to have no anxiety but to set the queen at rest,
      and no wish but to quiet and give pleasure to all around him, To me, he
      never yet spoke with such excess of benignity: he appeared even solicitous
      to satisfy me that he should do well, and to spare all alarm; but there
      was a hurry in his manner and voice that indicated sleep to be <span
      class="pagenum">226</span><a name="link226" id="link226"></a>indeed
      wanted. Nor could I, all night, forbear foreseeing &ldquo;He sleeps now,
      or to-morrow he will be surely delirious!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday, Nov. 2.&mdash;The king was better, and prevailed upon to give up
      going to the early prayers. The queen and princesses went. After they were
      gone, and I was following towards my room, the king called after me, and
      he kept me in discourse a full half hour nearly all the time they were
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all to the same purport; that he was well, but wanted more rest;
      yet he said he had slept the last night like a child. But his manner,
      still, was so touchingly kind, so softly gracious, that it doubled my
      concern to see him so far from well.

    <h2>
      DISTRESS OF THE QUEEN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nov. 3.&mdash;-We are all here in a most uneasy state. The king is better
      and worse so frequently, and changes so, daily, backwards and forwards,
      that everything is to be apprehended, if his nerves are not some way
      quieted. I dreadfully fear he is on the eve of some severe fever. The
      queen is almost overpowered with some secret terror. I am affected beyond
      all expression in her presence, to see what struggles she makes to support
      serenity. To-day she gave up the conflict when I was alone with her, and
      burst into a violent fit of tears. It was very, very terrible to see! How
      did I wish her a Susan or a Fredy! To unburthen her loaded mind would be
      to relieve it from all but inevitable affliction. O, may heaven in its
      mercy never, never drive me to that solitary anguish more! I have tried
      what it would do; I speak from bitter recollection of past melancholy
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes she walks up and down the room without uttering a word, but
      shaking her head frequently, and in evident distress and irresolution. She
      is often closeted with Miss Goldsworthy, of whom, I believe, she makes
      inquiry how her brother has found the king, from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princes both came to Kew, in several visits to the king. The Duke of
      York has also been here, and his fond father could hardly bear the
      pleasure of thinking him anxious for his health. &ldquo;So good,&rdquo; he
      says &ldquo;is Frederick!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To-night, indeed, at tea-time, I felt a great shock, in hearing, from
      General Budé, that Dr. Heberden had been called in. It is true more
      assistance seemed much wanting, yet the king&rsquo;s rooted aversion to
      physicians makes any new-comer tremendous.<span class="pagenum">227</span><a
      name="link227" id="link227"></a> They said, too, it was merely for
      counsel, not that his majesty was worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov. 4.&mdash;Passed much the same as the days preceding it, the queen in
      deep distress, the king in a state almost incomprehensible, and all the
      house uneasy and alarmed. The Drawing-room was again put off, and a steady
      residence seemed fixed at Windsor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov. 5.&mdash;I found my poor royal mistress, in the morning, sad and
      sadder still; something horrible seemed impending, and I saw her whole
      resource was in religion. We had talked lately much upon solemn Subjects,
      and she appeared already preparing herself to be resigned for whatever
      might happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was still wholly unsuspicious of the greatness of the cause she had for
      dread. Illness, a breaking up of the constitution, the payment of sudden
      infirmity and premature old age for the waste of unguarded health and
      strength,&mdash;these seemed to me the threats awaiting her; and great and
      grievous enough, yet how short of the fact!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had given up my walks some days; I was too uneasy to quit the house
      while the queen remained at home, and she now never left it. Even Lady
      Effingham, the last two days, could not obtain admission; She Could only
      hear from a page how the royal family went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon the king went out in his chaise, with the princess royal, for an
      airing. I looked from my window to see him; he was all smiling benignity,
      but gave so many orders to the postilions, and got in and out of the
      carriage twice, with such agitation, that again my fear of a great fever
      hanging over him grew more and more powerful. Alas! how little did I
      imagine I should see him no more for so long&mdash;so black a period!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went to my poor queen, still worse and worse I found her spirits.
      She had been greatly offended by some anecdote in a newspaper&mdash;the
      &ldquo;Morning Herald&rdquo;&mdash;relative to the king&rsquo;s
      indisposition. She declared the printer should be called to account. She
      bid me burn the paper, and ruminated upon who could be employed to
      represent to the editor that he must answer at his peril any further such
      treasonable paragraphs. I named to her Mr. Fairly, her own servant, and
      one so peculiarly fitted for any office requiring honour and discretion.
      &ldquo;Is he here, then?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered,
      but he was expected in a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw her concurrence with this proposal. The princess royal soon
      returned. She came in cheerfully, and gave, in<span class="pagenum">228</span><a
      name="link228" id="link228"></a> German, a history of the airing, and one
      that seemed Comforting. Soon after, suddenly arrived the Prince of Wales.
      He came into the room. He had just quitted Brighthelmstone. Something
      passing within seemed to render this meeting awfully distant on both
      sides. She asked if he should not return to Brighthelmstone? He answered
      yes, the next day, He desired to speak with her they retired together.

    <h2>
      FIRST OUTBURST OF THE KING&rsquo;s DELIRIUM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had but just reached my own room, deeply musing on the state of&rsquo;
      things, when a chaise stopped at the rails; and I saw Mr. Fairly and his
      son Charles alight, and enter the house. He walked lamely, and seemed not
      yet recovered from his late attack. Though most happy to see him at this
      alarming time, when I knew he could be most useful, as there is no one to
      whom the queen opens so confidentially upon her affairs, I had yet a fresh
      stair to see, by his anticipated arrival, though still lame, that he must
      have been sent for, and hurried hither.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Miss Planta dined with me. We were both nearly silent: I was shocked
      at I scarcely knew what, and she seemed to know too much for speech. She
      stayed with me till six o&rsquo;clock, but nothing passed, beyond general
      solicitude that the king might get better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, a stillness the most uncommon reigned over the whole house.
      Nobody stirred; not a voice was heard not a step, not a motion. I could do
      nothing but watch, without knowing for what; there seemed a strangeness in
      the house most extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock Columb came to tell me that the music was all
      forbid, and the musicians ordered away! This was the last step to be
      expected, so fond as his majesty is of his concert, and I thought it might
      have rather soothed him: I could not understand the prohibition; all
      seemed stranger and stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very late came General Budé. He looked extremely uncomfortable. Later
      still came Colonel Goldsworthy: his countenance all gloom, and his voice
      scarce articulating no or yes. General Grenville was gone to town. General
      Bud asked me if I had seen Mr. Fairly; and last Of all, at length, he also
      entered. How grave he looked, how shut up in himself! A silent bow was his
      only salutation <span class="pagenum">229</span><a name="link229"
      id="link229"></a> how changed I thought it,&mdash;and how fearful a
      meeting, SO long expected as a solace!
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Goldsworthy was called away: I heard his voice whispering some
      time in the passage, but he did not return. Various small speeches now
      dropped, by which I found the house was all in disturbance, and the king
      in some strange way worse, and the queen taken ill!
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, General Budé said he would go and see if any one was in the
      music-room. Mr. Fairly said he thought he had better not accompany him,
      for as he had not yet been seen, his appearance might excite fresh
      emotion. The general agreed, and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were now alone. But I could not speak: neither did Mr. Fairly. I worked&mdash;-I
      had begun a hassock for my Fredy. A long and serious pause made me almost
      turn sick with anxious wonder and fear, and an inward trembling totally
      disabled me from asking the actual situation of things; if I had not had
      my work, to employ my eyes and hands, I must have left the room to quiet
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fancy he penetrated into all this, though, at first, he had concluded me
      informed of everything; but he now, finding me silent, began an inquiry
      whether I was yet acquainted how bad all was become, and how ill the king?
      I really had no utterance for very alarm, but my look was probably
      sufficient; he kindly saved me any questions, and related to me the whole
      of the mysterious horror!
    </p>
    <p>
      O my dear friends, what a history! The king, at dinner, had broken forth
      into positive delirium, which long had been menacing all who saw him most
      closely; and the queen was so overpowered as to fall into violent
      hysterics. All the princesses were in misery, and the Prince of Wales had
      burst into tears. No one knew what was to follow&mdash;no one could
      conjecture the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke of the poor queen, in terms of the most tender compassion; he
      pitied her, he said, from the bottom of his soul; and all her sweet
      daughters, the lovely princesses&mdash;there was no knowing to what we
      might look forward for them all!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was an almost silent listener; but, having expressed himself very warmly
      for all the principal sufferers, he kindly, and with interest, examined
      me. &ldquo;How,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;are You? Are you strong? are you
      stout? can you go through such scenes as these? you do not look much
      fitted for them."<span class="pagenum">230</span><a name="link230"
      id="link230"></a> &ldquo;I shall do very well,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;for,
      at a time such as this, I shall surely forget myself utterly. The queen
      will be all to me. I shall hardly, I think, feel myself at liberty to be
      unhappy!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      AN ANXIOUS NIGHT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairly stayed with me all the evening, during which we heard no voice,
      no sound! all was deadly still!
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock I said, &ldquo;I must go to my own room, to be in
      waiting.&rdquo; He determined upon remaining downstairs, in the equerries&rsquo;
      apartment, there to wait some intelligence. We parted in mutual
      expectation of dreadful tidings. In separating, he took my hand, and
      earnestly recommended me to keep myself stout and firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this beginning of the night was affecting, what did it not grow
      afterwards Two long hours I waited-alone, in silence, in ignorance, in
      dread! I thought they would never be over; at twelve o&rsquo;clock I
      seemed to have spent two whole days in waiting. I then opened my door, to
      listen, in the passage, if anything seemed stirring. Not a sound could I
      hear. My apartment seemed wholly separated from life and motion. Whoever
      was in the house kept at the other end, and not even a servant crossed the
      stairs or passage by my rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would fain have crept on myself, anywhere in the world, for some
      inquiry, or to see but a face, and hear a voice, but I did not dare risk
      losing a sudden summons. I re-entered my room and there passed another
      endless hour, in conjectures too horrible to relate.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little after one, I heard a step&mdash;my door opened&mdash;and a page
      said I must come to the queen. I could hardly get along&mdash;hardly force
      myself into the room; dizzy I felt, almost to falling. But, the first
      shock passed, I became more collected. Useful, indeed, proved the previous
      lesson of the evening: it had stilled, If not fortified my mind, which had
      else, in a scene Such is this, been all tumult and emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      My poor royal mistress! never can I forget her countenance&mdash;pale,
      ghastly pale she looked; she was seated to be undressed, and attended by
      Lady Elizabeth Waldegrave and Miss Goldsworthy; her whole frame was
      disordered, yet she was still and quiet. These two ladies assisted me to
      undress her, or rather I assisted them, for they were firmer, from being<span
      class="pagenum">231</span><a name="link231" id="link231"></a> longer
      present; my shaking hands and blinded eyes could scarce be of any use. I
      gave her some camphor julep, which had been ordered her by Sir George
      Baker. &ldquo;How cold I am!&rdquo; she cried, and put her hand on mine;
      marble it felt! and went to my heart&rsquo;s core!
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, at the instance of Sir George Baker, had consented to sleep in
      the next apartment, as the queen was ill. For himself, he would listen to
      nothing. Accordingly, a bed was put up for him, by his own order, in the
      queen&rsquo;s second dressing-room, immediately adjoining to the bed-room.
      He would not be further removed. Miss Goldsworthy was to sit up with her,
      by the king&rsquo;s direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would fain have remained in the little dressing-room, on the other side
      the bed-room, but she would not permit it. She ordered Sandys, her
      wardrobe-woman, in the place of Mrs. Thielky, to sit up there. Lady
      Elizabeth also pressed to stay; but we were desired to go to our own
      rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      How reluctantly did I come away! how hardly to myself leave her! Yet I
      went to bed, determined to preserve my strength to the utmost of my
      ability, for the service of my unhappy mistress. I could not, however,
      sleep. I do not suppose an eye was closed in the house all night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov. 6.&mdash;I rose at six, dressed in haste by candle-light, and unable
      to wait for my summons in a suspense so awful, I stole along the passage
      in the dark, a thick fog intercepting all faint light, to see if I could
      meet with Sandys, or any one, to tell me how the night had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came to the little dressing-room, I stopped, irresolute what to do.
      I heard men&rsquo;s voices; I was seized with the most cruel alarm at such
      a sound in her majesty&rsquo;s dressing-room. I waited some time, and then
      the door opened, and I saw Colonel Goldsworthy and Mr. Batterscomb.<a
      href="#linknote-298" name="linknoteref-298" id="linknoteref-298"><small>298</small></a>
      I was relieved from my first apprehension, yet shocked enough to see them
      there at this early hour. They had both sat up there all night, as well as
      Sandys. Every page, both of the king and queen, had also sat up, dispersed
      in the passages and ante-rooms! and O what horror in every face I met! I
      waited here, amongst them, till Sandys was ordered by the queen to carry
      her a pair of gloves. I could not resist<span class="pagenum">232</span><a
      name="link232" id="link232"></a> the opportunity to venture myself before
      her. I glided into the room, but stopped at the door: she was in bed,
      sitting up; Miss Goldsworthy was on a stool by her side! I feared
      approaching without permission, yet could not prevail with myself to
      retreat. She was looking down, and did not see me. Miss Goldsworthy,
      turning round, said, &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis Miss Burney, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned her head forward, and in a most soft manner, said, &ldquo;Miss
      Burney, how are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deeply affected, I hastened up to her, but, in trying to speak, burst into
      an irresistible torrent of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dearest friends, I do it at this moment again, and can hardly write for
      them; yet I wish you to know all this piercing history right.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked like death&mdash;colourless and wan; but nature is infectious;
      the tears gushed from her own eyes, and a perfect agony of weeping ensued,
      which, once begun, she could not stop; she did not, indeed, try; for when
      it subsided, and she wiped her eyes, she said, &ldquo;I thank you, Miss
      Burney&mdash;you have made me cry&mdash;it is a great relief to me&mdash;I
      had not been able to cry before, all this night long.&rdquo; O, what a
      scene followed! what a scene was related! The king, in the middle of the
      night, had insisted upon seeing if his queen was not removed from the
      house and he had come into her room, with a candle in his hand, opened the
      bed-curtains, and satisfied himself she was there, and Miss Goldsworthy by
      her side. This observance of his directions had much soothed him; but he
      stayed a full half hour, and the depth of terror during that time no words
      can paint. The fear of such another entrance was now so strongly upon the
      nerves of the poor queen, that she could hardly support herself.

    <h2>
      THE KING&rsquo;S DELIRIOUS CONDITION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king-the royal sufferer-was still in the next room, attended by Sir
      George Baker and Dr. Heberden, and his pages, with Colonel Goldsworthy
      occasionally, and as he called for him. He kept talking unceasingly; his
      voice was so lost in hoarseness and weakness, it was rendered almost
      inarticulate; but its tone was still all benevolence&mdash;all kindness&mdash;all
      touching graciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thought advisable the queen should not rise, lest the king should
      be offended that she did not go to him; at present<span class="pagenum">233</span><a
      name="link233" id="link233"></a> he was content, because he conceived her
      to be nursing for her illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what a situation for her! She would not let me leave her now; she made
      me remain In the room, and ordered me to sit down. I was too trembling to
      refuse. Lady Elizabeth soon joined us. We all three stayed with her; she
      frequently bid me listen, to hear what the king was saying or doing. I
      did, and carried the best accounts I could manage, without deviating from
      truth, except by some omissions. Nothing could be so afflicting as this
      task; even now, it brings fresh to my ear his poor exhausted voice.
      &ldquo;I am nervous,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I am not ill, but I am
      nervous: if you would know what is the matter with me, I am nervous. But I
      love you both very well; if you would tell me truth: I love Dr. Heberden
      best, for he has not told me a lie: Sir George has told me a lie&mdash;a
      white lie, he says, but I hate a white lie. If you will tell me a lie, let
      it be a black lie!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was what he kept saying almost constantly, mixed in with other
      matter, but always returning, and in a voice that truly will never cease
      vibrating in my recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen permitted me to make her breakfast and attend her, and was so
      affectingly kind and gentle in her distress, that I felt a tenderness of
      sorrow for her that almost devoted my whole mind to her alone! Miss
      Goldsworthy was a fixture at her side; I, therefore, provided her
      breakfast also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Elizabeth was sent out on inquiries of Colonel Goldsworthy, and Mr.
      Batterscomb, and the pages, every ten minutes; while I, at the same
      intervals, was ordered to listen to what passed in the room, and give
      warning if anything seemed to threaten another entrance... .
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen bid me bring the prayer book and read the morning service to
      her. I could hardly do it, the poor voice from the next room was so
      perpetually in my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came to my room, about twelve o&rsquo;clock, for some breakfast, I
      found a letter from Lady Carmarthen. It was an answer to my congratulation
      upon her marriage, and written with honest happiness and delight. She
      frankly calls herself the luckiest of all God&rsquo;s creatures; and this,
      if not elegant, is sincere, and I hope will be permanently her opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      While swallowing my breakfast, standing and in haste, and the door ajar, I
      heard Mr. Fairly&rsquo;s voice, saying, &ldquo;Is Miss Burney there? is
      she alone?&rdquo; and then he sent in Columb, to inquire if he might come
      and ask me how I did.<span class="pagenum">234</span><a name="link234"
      id="link234"></a> I received him with as much gladness as I could then
      feel, but it was a melancholy reception. I consulted with him upon many
      points in which I wanted counsel: he is quick and deep at once in
      expedients where anything, is to be done, and simple and clear in
      explaining himself where he thinks it is best to do nothing. Miss
      Goldsworthy herself had once stolen out to Consult with him. He became,
      indeed, for all who belonged to the queen, from this moment the oracle.

      THE KING REFUSES TO SEE DR. WARREN.

      Dr. Warren<a href="#linknote-299" name="linknoteref-299"
      id="linknoteref-299"><small>299</small></a> had been sent for express, in
      the middle of the night, at the desire of Sir George Baker, because he had
      been taken ill himself, and felt unequal to the whole toll.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned speedily to the room of woe. The arrival of the physicians was
      there grievously awaited, for Dr. Heberden and Sir George would now decide
      upon nothing till Dr. Warren came. The poor queen wanted something very
      positive to pass, relative to her keeping away, which seemed thought
      essential at this time, though the courage to assert it was wanting In
      everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princesses sent to ask leave to come to their mother. She burst into
      tears, and declared she could neither see them, nor pray, while in this
      dreadful situation, expecting every moment to be broken in upon, and quite
      uncertain in what manner, yet determined not to desert her apartment,
      except by express direction from the physicians. Who could tell to what
      height the delirium might rise? There was no constraint, no power: all
      feared the worst, yet none dared take any measures for security.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princes also sent word they were at her majesty&rsquo;s command, but
      she shrunk still more from this Interview: it filled her with a thousand
      dreadful sensations, too obvious to be wholly hid.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length news was brought that Dr. Warren was arrived. I never felt so
      rejoiced: I could have run out to welcome him with rapture. With what
      cruel impatience did we then wait to hear his sentence! An impatience how
      fruitless! It ended in information that he had not seen the king, who
      refused him admittance.<span class="pagenum">235</span><a name="link235"
      id="link235"></a> This was terrible. But the king was never so despotic;
      no one dared oppose him. He would not listen to a word, though, when
      unopposed, he was still all gentleness and benignity to every one around
      him. Dr. Warren was then planted where he could hear his voice, and all
      that passed, and receive Intelligence concerning his pulse, etc., from Sir
      George Baker.

      Lady Elizabeth and Miss Goldsworthy earnestly pressed her to remove to a
      more distant apartment, where he might not hear the unceasing voice of the
      unhappy king; but she would only rise and go to the &lsquo;little
      dressing-room, there to wait in her night-clothes Dr. Warren&rsquo;s
      determination what step she should take.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Lady Elizabeth learnt among the pages that Dr. Warren had
      quitted his post of watching. The poor queen now, in a torrent of tears,
      prepared herself for seeing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came not.
    </p>
    <p>
      All astonished and impatient, Lady Elizabeth was sent out on inquiries.
      She returned, and said Dr. Warren was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run! stop him!&rdquo; was the queen&rsquo;s next order. &ldquo;Let
      him but let me know what I am to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor, poor queen! how I wept to hear those words!
    </p>
    <p>
      Abashed and distressed, poor Lady Elizabeth returned. She had seen Colonel
      Goldsworthy, and heard Dr. Warren,-with the other two physicians, had left
      the house too far to be recalled they were gone over to the Castle, to the
      Prince of Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think a deeper blow I have never witnessed. Already to become but
      second, even for the king! The tears were now wiped; indignation arose,
      with pain, the severest pain, of every species.

    <h2>
      THE QUEEN REMOVES TO MORE DISTANT APARTMENTS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In about a quarter of an hour Colonel Goldsworthy sent in to beg an
      audience. It was granted, a long cloak only being thrown over the queen.
      He now brought the opinion of all the physicians in consultation, &ldquo;That
      her majesty would <span class="pagenum">236</span><a name="link236"
      id="link236"></a>remove to a more distant apartment, since the king would
      undoubtedly be worse from the agitation of seeing her, and there Could be
      no possibility to prevent it while she remained so near.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She instantly agreed, but with what bitter anguish! Lady Elizabeth, Miss
      Goldsworthy, and myself attended her; she went to an apartment in the same
      row, but to which there Was no entrance except by its own door. It
      consisted of only two rooms, a bed-chamber and a dressing-room. They are
      appropriated to the lady-in-waiting, when she is here.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the entrance into this new habitation the poor wretched queen once more
      gave way to a perfect agony of grief and affliction; while the words
      &ldquo;What will become of me! What will become of me!&rdquo; uttered with
      the most piercing lamentation, struck deep and hard into all our hearts.
      Never can I forget their desponding sound; they implied such complicated
      apprehensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly now the princesses were sent for. The three elder hastened down.
      O, what a meeting! They all, from a habit that has become a second nature,
      struggling to repress all outward grief, though the queen herself, wholly
      overcome, wept even aloud. They all went into the bedroom, and the queen
      made a slight dressing, but only wore a close gauze cap, and her long
      dressing gown, which is a dimity chemise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was then sent back to the little dressing-room, for something that was
      left; as I opened the door, I almost ran against a gentleman close to it
      in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the queen here?&rdquo; he cried, and I then saw the Prince of
      Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, shuddering at this new scene for her
      &ldquo;should I tell her majesty your royal highness is here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This I said lest he should surprise her. But he did not intend that: he
      was profoundly respectful, and consented to wait at the door while I went
      in, but called me back, as I turned away, to add, &ldquo;You will be so
      good to say I am come by her orders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She wept a deluge of tears when I delivered my commission, but instantly
      admitted him. I then retreated. The other two ladies went to Lady
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s room, which is next the queen&rsquo;s new apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the passage I was again stopped; it was by Mr. Fairly. I would have
      hurried on, scarce able to speak, but he desired to know how the queen
      did. &ldquo;Very bad,&rdquo; was all I could say,<span class="pagenum">237</span><a
      name="link237" id="link237"></a> and on I hastened to my own room, which,
      the next minute, I would as eagerly have hastened to quit, from its
      distance from all that was going forward; but now once the prince had
      entered the queen&rsquo;s rooms, I could go thither no more unsummoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miserable, lonely, and filled with dreadful conjectures, I remained here
      till a very late dinner brought Miss Planta to the dining-parlour, where I
      joined her. After a short and dismal meal we immediately parted: she to
      wait in the apartments of the princesses above-stairs, in case of being
      wanted; I to my own solitary parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince of Wales and Duke of York stayed here all the day, and were so
      often in and out of the queen&rsquo;s rooms that no one could enter them
      but by order. The same etiquette is observed when the princes are with the
      queen as when the king is there-no interruption whatever is made. I now,
      therefore, lost my only consolation at this calamitous time, that of
      attending my poor royal mistress.

    <h2>
      A VISIT FROM MR. FAIRLY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alone wholly, without seeing a human being, or gathering any, the smallest
      intelligence of what was going forwards, I remained till tea-time.
      Impatient then for information, I planted myself in the eating-parlour;
      but no one came. Every minute seemed an hour. I grew as anxious for the
      tea society as heretofore I had been anxious to escape it; but so late it
      grew, and so hopeless, that Columb came to propose bringing in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; for I could swallow nothing voluntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes he came again, and with the compliments of Mr. Fairly,
      who desired him to tell me he would wait Upon me to tea whenever I
      pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little surprised at this single message, but most truly rejoiced, I
      returned my compliments, with an assurance that all time was the same to
      me. He came directly, and indeed his very sight, at this season of still
      horror and silent suspense, was a repose to my poor aching eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;nobody else. The physicians
      being now here, Colonel Goldsworthy thought it right to order tea for the
      whole party in the music-room, which we have now agreed to make the
      general waiting-room for us all. It is near the king, and we ought always
      to be at hand.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">238</span><a name="link238"
      id="link238"></a> Our tea was very sad. He gave me no hope Of a short
      seizure; he saw it, in perspective, as long as it was dreadful: perhaps
      even worse than long, he thought it&mdash;but that he said not. He related
      to me the whole of the day&rsquo;s transactions, but my most dear and most
      honourable friends will be the first to forgive me when I promise that I
      shall commit nothing to paper on this terrible event that is told me in
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not stay long&mdash;he did not think it right to leave his waiting
      friends for any time, nor could I wish it, valued as I know he is by them
      all, and much as they need his able counsel. He left me plunged in a deep
      gloom, yet he was not gloomy himself; he sees evils as things of course,
      and bears them, therefore, as things expected. But he was tenderly touched
      for the poor queen and the princesses.

    <h2>
      THE KING&rsquo;S NIGHT WATCHERS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not till one in the morning did I see another face, and then I attended my
      poor unhappy queen. She was now fixed in her new apartments, bed-room and
      dressing-room, and stirred not a step but from one to the other.
      Fortunately all are upon the ground-floor, both for king and queen; so are
      the two Lady Waldegraves&rsquo; and mine; the princesses and Miss Planta,
      as usual, are upstairs, and the gentlemen lodge above them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Goldsworthy had now a bed put up in the queen&rsquo;s new bed-room.
      She had by no means health to go on sitting up, and it had been the poor
      king&rsquo;s own direction that she should remain with the queen. It was
      settled that Mrs. Sandys and Mrs. Macenton should alternately sit up in
      the dressing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen would not permit me to take that office, though most gladly I
      would have taken any that would have kept me about her. But she does; not
      think my strength sufficient. She allowed me however to stay with her till
      she was in bed, which I had never done till now; I never, indeed, had even
      seen her in her bed-room till the day before. She has always had the
      kindness and delicacy, to dismiss me from her dressing-room as soon as I
      have assisted her with her night-clothes; the wardrobe-woman then was
      summoned, and I regularly made my courtesy. It was a satisfaction to me,
      however, now to leave her the last, and to come to her the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her present dressing-room is also her dining-room, her<span class="pagenum">239</span><a
      name="link239" id="link239"></a> drawing-room, her sitting-room; she has
      nothing else but her bed-room!
    </p>
    <p>
      I left her with my fervent prayers for better times, and saw her nearer to
      composure than I had believed possible in such a calamity. She called to
      her aid her religion, and without it what, indeed, must have become of
      her? It was near two in the morning when I quitted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In passing through the dressing-room to come away, I found Miss
      Goldsworthy in some distress how to execute a commission of the queen&rsquo;s:
      it was to her brother, who was to sit up in a room adjoining to the king&rsquo;s;
      and she was undressed, and knew not how to go to him, as the princes were
      to and fro everywhere. I offered to call him to her she thankfully
      accepted the proposal. I cared not, just then, whom I encountered, so I
      could make myself of any use.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I gently opened the door of the apartment to which I was directed, I
      found it was quite filled with gentlemen and attendants, arranged round it
      on chairs and sofas in dead silence. It was a dreadful start, with which I
      retreated; for anything more alarming and shocking could not be conceived!
      the poor king within another door, unconscious any one was near him, and
      thus watched, by dread necessity, at such an hour of the night! I
      pronounced the words &ldquo;Colonel Goldsworthy,&rdquo; however, before I
      drew back, though I could not distinguish one gentleman from another,
      except the two princes, by their stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited in the next room; but instead of Colonel Goldsworthy, my call was
      answered by Mr. Fairly. I acquainted him with my errand. He told me he had
      himself insisted that Colonel Goldsworthy should go to bed, as he had sat
      up all the preceding night and he had undertaken to supply his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went back to Miss Goldsworthy with this account. She begged me to
      entreat Mr. Fairly would come to her, as she must now make the commission
      devolve on him, and could less than ever appear, herself, as they were all
      assembled in such a party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairly, most considerately, had remained in this quiet room to see if
      anything more might be wanted, which spared me the distress of again
      intruding into the public room. I begged him to follow, and we were
      proceeding to the dressing-room, when I was stopped by a gentleman, who
      said, &ldquo;Does the queen want anybody?"<span class="pagenum">240</span><a
      name="link240" id="link240"></a> It was the Prince of Wales. &ldquo;Not
      the queen, sir,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but Miss Goldsworthy, has
      desired to see Mr. Fairly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He let me pass, but stopped Mr. Fairly; and, as he seemed inclined to
      detain him some time, I only told Miss Goldsworthy what had retarded him,
      and made off to my own room, and soon after two o&rsquo;clock, I believe,
      I was in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A CHANGE IN MISS BURNEYs DUTIES.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friday, Nov. 7.&mdash;I was now arrived at a sort of settled regularity of
      life more melancholy than can possibly be described. I rose at six,
      dressed, and hastened to the queen&rsquo;s apartments, uncalled, and there
      waited in silence and in the dark till I heard her move or speak with Miss
      Goldsworthy, and then presented myself to the sad bedside of the unhappy
      queen. She sent Miss Goldsworthy early every morning, to make inquiry what
      sort of night his majesty had passed; and in the middle of the night she
      commonly Also sent for news by the wardrobe-woman, or Miss Macenton,
      whichever sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dismissed Miss Goldsworthy, on my arrival, to dress herself. Lady
      Elizabeth Waldegrave accommodated her with her own room for that purpose.
      I had then a long conference with this most patient sufferer and equal
      forbearance and quietness during a period of suspensive unhappiness never
      have I seen, never could I have imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon now I never saw her, which I greatly regretted but she kept on her
      dressing-gown all day, and the princes were continually about the
      passages, so that no one unsummoned dared approach the queen&rsquo;s
      apartments. It was only therefore at night and morning I could see her but
      my heart was with her the livelong day. And how long, good heaven! how
      long that day became! Endless I used to think it, for nothing could I do&mdash;to
      wait and to watch&mdash;starting at every sound, yet revived by every
      noise.

    <h2>
      MR. FAIRLY SUCCEEDS IN SOOTHING THE KING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While I was yet with my poor royal sufferer this morning the Prince of
      Wales came hastily into the room. He apologized for his intrusion, and
      then gave a very energetic history of the preceding night. It had been
      indeed most affectingly dreadful! The king had risen in the middle of the
      night, and<span class="pagenum">241</span><a name="link241" id="link241"></a>
      would take no denial to walking into the next room. There he saw the large
      congress I have mentioned: amazed and in consternation, he demanded what
      they did there&mdash;Much followed that I have heard since, particularly
      the warmest éloge on his dear son Frederick&mdash;his favourite, his
      friend. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Frederick is my friend!&rdquo;
      and this son was then present amongst the rest, but not seen!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir George Baker was there, and was privately exhorted by the gentlemen to
      lead the king back to his room; but he had not courage: he attempted only
      to speak, and the king penned him in a corner, told him he was a mere old
      woman&mdash;that he wondered he had ever followed his advice, for he knew
      nothing of his complaint, which was only nervous!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince of Wales, by signs and whispers, would have urged others to
      have drawn him away, but no one dared approach him, and he remained there
      a considerable time. &ldquo;Nor do I know when he would have been got
      back,&rdquo; continued the prince, &ldquo;if at last Mr. Fairly had not
      undertaken him. I am extremely obliged to Mr. Fairly indeed. He came
      boldly up to him, and took him by the arm, and begged him to go to bed,
      and then drew him along, and said he must go. Then he said he would not,
      and cried ‘Who are you?&rsquo; &lsquo;I am Mr. Fairly, sir,&rsquo; he
      answered, &lsquo;and your majesty has been very good to me often, and now
      I am going to be very good to you, for you must come to bed, sir: it is
      necessary to your life.&rsquo; And then he was so surprised, that he let
      himself be drawn along just like a child; and so they got him to bed. I
      believe else he would have stayed all night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairly has had some melancholy experience in a case of this sort, with
      a very near connexion of his own. How fortunate he was present!

    <h2>
      NEW ARRANGEMENTS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At noon I had the most sad pleasure of receiving Mr. and Mrs. Smelt. They
      had heard in York of the illness of the king, and had travelled-post to
      Windsor. Poor worthy, excellent couple!&mdash;Ill and infirm, what did
      they not suffer from an attack like this&mdash;so wonderfully unexpected
      upon a patron so adored!
    </p>
    <p>
      They wished the queen to be acquainted with their arrival, yet would not
      let me risk meeting the princes in carrying the news. Mr. Smelt I saw
      languished to see his king: he was<span class="pagenum">242</span><a
      name="link242" id="link242"></a> persuaded he might now repay a part of
      former benefits, and he wished to be made his page during his illness,
      that he might watch and attend him hourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had had a message in the morning by Mr. Gorton, the clerk of the
      kitchen, to tell me the Prince of Wales wished our dining-parlour to be
      appropriated to the physicians, both for their dinner and their
      consultations. I was therefore obliged to order dinner for Miss Planta,
      and myself in my own Sitting-parlour, which was now unmaterial, as the
      equerries did not come to tea, but continued +altogether in the
      music-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, of course, came Mr. Fairly, but then it was only to let me
      know it would be of course no longer. He then rang the bell for my
      tea-urn, finding I had waited, though he 0 declined drinking tea with me;
      but he sat down, and staved half an hour, telling me the long story he had
      promised which Was a full detail of the terrible preceding night. The
      transactions of the day also he related to me, and the designs for the
      future. How alarming were they all! yet many particulars, he said, he
      omitted, merely because they were yet more affecting, and could be dwelt
      upon to no purpose.

    <h2>
      THE PRINCESS AUGUSTA&rsquo;S BIRTHDAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Saturday, Nov. 8-This was, if possible, the saddest day yet passed: it was
      the birthday of Princess Augusta, and Mrs. Siddons had been invited to
      read a play, and a large party of company to form the audience. What a
      contrast from such an intention was the event!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went, before seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, to my most unhappy
      royal mistress, the princes were both in the room. I retreated to the next
      apartment till they had finished their conference. The Prince of Wales
      upon these occasions has always been extremely well-bred and condescending
      in his manner, which, in a situation such as mine, is no immaterial
      circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor queen then spoke to me of the birthday present she had designed
      for her most amiable daughter. She hesitated a little whether or not to
      produce it, but at length meekly said, &ldquo;Yes, go to Miss Planta and
      bring it. Do you think there can be any harm in giving it now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no!&rdquo; I said, happy to encourage whatever was a little less
      gloomy, and upstairs I flew. I was met by all the poor princesses and the
      Duke of York, who inquired if he might go<span class="pagenum">243</span><a
      name="link243" id="link243"></a> again to the queen. I begged leave first
      to execute my commission. I did; but so engrossed was my mind with the
      whole of this living tragedy, that I so little noticed what it was I
      carried as to be now unable to recollect it. I gave it, however, to the
      queen, who then sent for the princesses, and carried her gift to her
      daughter, weeping, who received it with a silent courtesy, kissing and
      wetting with her gentle tears the hand of her afflicted mother.

    <h2>
      STRANGE BEHAVIOUR OF THE FIRST GENTLEMAN IN EUROPE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During my mournful breakfast poor Mr. Smelt arrived from Kew, where he had
      now settled himself. Mr. de Luc also joined us, and they could neither
      prevail upon themselves to go away all the morning. Mr. Smelt had some
      thoughts of taking up his abode in Windsor till the state of things should
      be more decisive. The accounts of the preceding night had been most cruel,
      and to quit the spot was scarce supportable to him. Yet he feared the
      princes might disapprove his stay, and he well knew his influence and
      welcome at Court was all confined to the sick-room: thence, there could
      now issue no mandate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I encouraged him to stay; so did Mr. de Luc; and while he was still
      wavering he saw Dr. Warren in the courtyard, and again hastened to speak
      with him. Before he returned the Prince of Wales went out and met him; and
      you may imagine how much I was pleased to observe from the window that he
      took him by the arm, and walked up and down with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came to us he said the prince had told him he had better stay,
      that he might see the queen. He determined, therefore, to send off an
      express to Mrs. Smelt, and go and secure an apartment at the inn. This was
      very soothing to me, who so much needed just such consolation as he could
      bestow and I begged he would come back to dinner, and spend the whole day
      in my room, during his stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, however, was my concern and amaze, when, soon after, hastily
      returning, he desired to speak to me alone, and, as Mr. de Luc moved off,
      told me he was going back immediately to Kew! He spoke with a tremor that
      alarmed me. I entreated to know why such a change? He then informed me
      that the porter, Mr. Humphreys, had refused him re-entrance, and sent him
      his great coat! He had resented this<span class="pagenum">244</span><a
      name="link244" id="link244"></a> impertinence, and was told it was by the
      express order of the prince! In utter astonishment he then only desired
      admittance for one moment to my room, and having acquainted me with this
      circumstance, he hurried off, in a state of distress, and indignation that
      left me penetrated with both.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time, as the poor king grew worse, general hope seemed
      universally to abate; and the Prince of Wales now took the government of
      the house into his own hands. Nothing was done but by his orders, and he
      was applied to in every difficulty. The queen interfered not in anything
      she lived entirely in her two new rooms, and spent the whole day in
      patient sorrow and retirement with her daughters.

    <h2>
      STRINGENT NEW REGULATIONS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next news that reached me, through Mr. de Luc, was, that the prince
      had sent his commands to the porter, to admit only four persons into the
      house on any pretence whatever these were Mr. Majendie, Mr. Turbulent,
      General Harcourt, and Mr. de Luc himself; and these were ordered to repair
      immediately to the equerry-room below stairs, while no one whatsoever was
      to be allowed to go to any other apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time commenced a total banishment from all intercourse out of
      the house, and an unremitting confinement within its walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mr. de Luc, however, could not forego coming to my room. He
      determined to risk that, since he was upon the list of those who might
      enter the house. I was glad, because he is a truly good man, and our
      sentiments upon this whole melancholy business were the same. But
      otherwise, the weariness of a great length of visit daily from a person so
      slow and methodical in discourse, so explanatory of everything and of
      nothing, at this agitating period, was truly painful to endure. He has
      often talked to me till my poor burthened head has seemed lost to all
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had now, all tea-meetings being over, no means of gaining any
      particulars of what was passing, which added so much to the horror of the
      situation, that by the evening I was almost petrified. Imagine, then,
      alike my surprise and satisfaction at a visit from Mr. Fairly. He had
      never come to me so unexpectedly. I eagerly begged an account of what was
      going on, and, with his usual readiness and accuracy, he gave it me in
      full detail. And nothing could be more tragic than all the<span
      class="pagenum">245</span><a name="link245" id="link245"></a> particulars
      every species of evil seemed now hanging over this unhappy family.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had had his son with him in his room upstairs; &ldquo;And I had a good
      mind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to have brought him to visit YOU.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I assured him he would have been a very welcome guest; and when he added
      that he could no longer have him at the Equerry table to dinner, as the
      Prince of Wales now presided there, I invited him for the next day to
      mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He not only instantly accepted the proposal, but cried, with great
      vivacity, &ldquo;I wish you would invite me too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought he was laughing, but said, &ldquo;Certainly, if such a thing
      might be allowed;&rdquo; and then, to my almost speechless surprise, he
      declared, If I would give him permission, he would dine with me next day.
      He then proceeded to say that the hurry, and fatigue, and violent animal
      spirits of the other table quite overpowered him, and a respite of such a
      quiet sort would be of essential service to him. Yet he paused a little
      afterwards, upon the propriety of leaving the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s
      table, and said &ldquo;He would first consult with General Budé, and hear
      his opinion.&rdquo; Sunday, Nov. 9.&mdash;-No one went to church&mdash;not
      a creature now quits the house: but I believe devotion never less required
      the aid and influence of public worship. For me, I know, I spent almost my
      whole time between prayer and watching. Even my melancholy resource, my
      tragedy, was now thrown aside; misery so actual, living, and present, was
      knit too closely around me to allow my depressed imagination to fancy any
      woe beyond what my heart felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In coming early from the queen&rsquo;s apartment this morning I was
      addressed by a gentleman who inquired how I did, by my name; but my
      bewilderment made him obliged to tell his own before I could recollect
      him. It was Dr. Warren.
    </p>
    <p>
      I eagerly expressed my hopes and satisfaction in his attendance upon the
      poor king, but he would not enter upon that subject. I suppose he feared,
      from my zeal, some indiscreet questions concerning his opinion of the
      case; for he passed by all I could start, to answer only with speeches
      relative to myself-of his disappointment in never meeting me, though
      residing under the same roof, his surprise in not dining with me when told
      he was to dine in my room, and the strangeness of never seeing me when so
      frequently he heard my name.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not bring myself to ask him to my apartment, when<span
      class="pagenum">246</span><a name="link246" id="link246"></a> I saw, by
      his whole manner, e held it imprudent to speak with me about the only
      subject on which I wished to talk&mdash;the king; and just then seeing the
      Duke of York advancing, I hastily retreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was dressing, Mr. Fairly rapped at my door. I sent out Goter, who
      brought me his compliments, and, if it would not be inconvenient to me, he
      and his son would have the pleasure of dining with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I answered, I should be very glad of their company, as would Miss Planta.
      Miss Goldsworthy had now arranged herself with the Lady Waldegraves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our dinner was as pleasant as a dinner at such a season could be. Mr.
      Fairly holds cheerfulness as a duty in the midst of every affliction that
      can admit it; and, therefore, whenever his animal spirits have a tendency
      to rise, he encourages and sustains them, So fond, too, is he of his son,
      that his very sight is a cordial to him and that mild, feeling, amiable
      boy quite idolizes his father, looking up to him, hanging on his arm, and
      watching his eye to smile and be smiled upon, with a fondness like that of
      an infant to its maternal nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeatedly Mr. Fairly exclaimed, &ldquo;What a relief is this, to dine
      thus quietly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What a relief should I, too, have found it, but for a little circumstance,
      which I will soon relate.

    <h2>
      MRS. SCHWELLENBERG IS BACK AGAIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We were still at table, with the dessert, when Columb entered and
      announced the sudden return from Weymouth of Mrs. Schwellenberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up we all started; Miss Planta flew out to receive her, and state the
      situation of the house; Mr. Fairly, expecting, I believe, she was coming
      into my room, hastily made his exit without a word; his son eagerly
      scampered after him, and I followed Miss Planta upstairs. My reception,
      however, was such as to make me deem it most proper to again return to my
      room. What an addition this to the gloom of all! and to begin at once with
      harshness and rudeness! I could hardly tell how to bear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov. 10.&mdash;This was a most dismal day. The dear and most suffering
      king was extremely ill, the queen very wretched, poor Mrs. Schwellenberg
      all spasm and horror, Miss Planta all restlessness, the house all mystery,
      and my only informant and<span class="pagenum">247</span><a name="link247"
      id="link247"></a> comforter distanced. Not a word, the whole day through,
      did I hear of what was passing or intending. Our dinner was worse than an
      almost famished fasting; we parted after it, and met no more. Mrs.
      Schwellenberg, who never drinks tea herself, hearing the general party was
      given up, and never surmising there had ever been any particular one,
      neither desired me to come to her, nor proposed returning to me. She took
      possession of the poor queen&rsquo;s former dressing-room, and between
      that and the adjoining apartments she spent all the day, except during
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov. 11.&mdash;This day passed like the preceding; I only saw her majesty
      in the morning, and not another human being from that hour till Mrs.
      Schwellenberg and Miss Planta came to dinner. Nor could I then gather any
      information of the present state of things, as Mrs. Schwellenberg
      announced that nothing must be talked of.
    </p>
    <p>
      To give any idea of the dismal horror of passing so many hours in utter
      ignorance, where every interest of the mind was sighing for intelligence,
      would not be easy: the experiment alone could give it its full force; and
      from that, Heaven ever guard my loved readers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov. 12.&mdash;To-day a little brightened upon us some change appeared in
      the loved royal sufferer, and though it was not actually for the better in
      itself, yet any change was pronounced to be salutary, as, for some days
      pas&rsquo;&rsquo; there had been a monotonous continuation of the same bad
      symptoms, that had doubly depressed us all. My spirits rose immediately;
      indeed, I thank God, I never desponded, though many times I stood nearly
      alone in my hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the passage, in the morning, I encountered Colonel Gwynn. I had but
      just time to inform him I yet thought all would do well, ere the princes
      appeared. All the equerries are now here except Major Garth, who is ill;
      and they have all ample employment in watching and waiting. From time to
      time they have all interviews; but it is only because the poor king will
      not be denied seeing them: it is not thought light. But I must enter into
      nothing of this sort-it is all too closely connected with private domestic
      concerns for paper. After dinner, my chief guest, la Présidente, told me,
      &ldquo;If my room was not so warm, she would stay a little with me.&rdquo;
      I felt this would be rather too superlative an obligation; and therefore I
      simply answered that &ldquo;I was too chilly to sit in a<span
      class="pagenum">248</span><a name="link248" id="link248"></a> cold room;&rdquo;
      and I confess I took no pains to temper it according to this hint.

    <h2>
      PUBLIC PRAYERS FOR THE KING DECIDED UPON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Finding there was now no danger Of disagreeable interviews, Mr. Fairly
      renewed his visits as usual. He came early this evening, and narrated the
      state of things; and then, with a laugh, he Inquired What I had done With
      my head companion, and how I got rid of her? I fairly told him my malice
      about the temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not help laughing, though he instantly remonstrated against an
      expedient that might prove prejudicial to my health. &ldquo;You had better
      not,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;try any experiments of this sort: if you hurt
      Your nerves, it may prove a permanent evil; this other can only be
      temporary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up the &ldquo;Task&rdquo; again; but he opened, by ill luck, upon
      nothing striking or good; and soon, with distaste, flung the book down,
      and committed himself wholly to conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told me he wished much he had been able to consult with me on the
      preceding morning, when he had the queen&rsquo;s orders to write, in her
      majesty&rsquo;s name, to the Archbishop of Canterbury, to issue out public
      prayers for the poor king, for all the churches.
    </p>
    <p>
      I assured him I fancied it might do very well without my aid. There was to
      be a privy council summoned, in consequence of the letter, to settle the
      mode of compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      How right a step in my ever-right royal mistress is this! If you hear less
      of her now, my dearest friends, and of the internal transactions, it is
      only because I now rarely saw her but alone, and all that passed,
      therefore, was in promised confidence. And, for the rest, the whole of my
      information concerning the princes, and the plans and the proceedings of
      the house, was told me in perfect reliance on my secrecy and honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know this is saying enough to the most honourable of all confidants and
      friends to whom I am writing. All that passes with regard to myself is
      laid completely before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov. 13&mdash;This was the fairest day we have passed since the first
      seizure of the most beloved of monarchs. He was considerably better. O
      what a ray of joy lightened us, and how mildly did my poor queen receive
      it<span class="pagenum">249</span><a name="link249" id="link249"></a> Nov.
      14&mdash;Still all was greatly amended, and better spirits reigned
      throughout the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairly&mdash;I can write of no one else, for no one else did I see&mdash;called
      early, to tell me he had received an answer relative to the prayer for his
      majesty&rsquo;s recovery, in consequence of which he had the queen&rsquo;s
      commands for going to town the next day, to see the archbishop. This was
      an employment so suited to the religious cast of his character, that I
      rejoiced to see it fall into his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came again in the evening, and said he had now got the prayer. He did
      not entirely approve it, nor think it sufficiently warm and animated. I
      petitioned to hear it, and he readily complied, and read it with great
      reverence, but very unaffectedly and quietly. I was very, very much
      touched by It; yet not, I own, quite so much as once before by another,
      which was read to me by Mr. Cambridge, and composed by his son, for the
      sufferings of his excellent daughter Catherine. It was at once so devout,
      yet so concise&mdash;so fervent, yet so simple, and the many tender
      relations concerned in it&mdash;father, brother, sister,&mdash;so
      powerfully affected me, that I had no command over the feelings then
      excited, even though Mr. Cambridge almost reproved me for want of
      fortitude; but there was something so tender in a prayer of a brother for
      a sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, however, I was under better control for though my whole heart was
      filled with the calamitous state of this unhappy monarch, and with deepest
      affliction for all his family, I yet knew so well my reader was one to
      severely censure all failure in calmness and firmness, that I struggled,
      and not ineffectually, to hear him with a steadiness like his own. But,
      fortunately for the relief of this force, he left the room for a few
      minutes to see if he was wanted, and I made use of his absence to give a
      little vent to those tears which I had painfully restrained in his
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned we had one of the best (on his part) conversations in
      which I have ever been engaged, upon the highest and most solemn of all
      subjects, prayers and supplications to heaven. He asked my opinion with
      earnestness, and gave his own with unbounded openness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov. 15-This morning my poor royal mistress herself presented me with one
      of the prayers for the king. I shall always keep it&mdash;how&mdash;how
      fervently did I use it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst I was at breakfast Mr. Fairly once more called before he set off
      for town and he brought me also a copy of the<span class="pagenum">250</span><a
      name="link250" id="link250"></a> prayer. He had received a large packet of
      them from the archbishop, Dr. Moore, to distribute in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole day the king continued amended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday, Nov. 16.&mdash;This morning I ventured out to church. I did not
      like to appear abroad, but yet I had a most irresistible earnestness to
      join the public congregation in the prayer for the king. Indeed nothing
      could be more deeply moving: the very sound of the cathedral service,
      performed in his own chapel, overset me at once; and every prayer in the
      service in which he was mentioned brought torrents of tears from all the
      suppliants that joined in them. I could scarcely keep my place, scarce
      command my voice from audible sobs. To come to the House of prayer from
      such a house of woe! I ran away when the service was over, to avoid
      inquiries. Mrs. Kennedy ran after me, with swollen eyes; I could not
      refuse her a hasty answer, but I ran the faster after it, to avoid any
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was worse. His night had been very bad; all the fair promise of
      amendment was shaken; he had now some symptoms even dangerous to his life.
      O good heaven, what a day did this prove! I saw not a human face, save at
      dinner and then, what faces! gloom and despair in all, and silence to
      every species of intelligence....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was melancholy to see the crowds of former welcome visitors who were
      now denied access. The prince reiterated his former orders; and I
      perceived from my window those who had ventured to the door returning back
      in deluges of tears. Amongst them to-day I perceived poor Lady Effingham,
      the Duchess of Ancaster, and Mr. Bryant; the last sent me In, afterwards,
      a mournful little letter, to which he desired no answer. Indeed I was not
      at liberty to write a word.

    <h2>
      SIR LUCAS PEPYS ON THE KING&rsquo;S CONDITION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nov. 19.&mdash;The account of the dear king this morning was rather
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Lucas Pepys was now called in, and added to Dr. Warren, Dr. Heberden,
      and Sir George Baker. I earnestly wished to see him, and I found my poor
      royal mistress was secretly anxious to know his opinion. I sent to beg to
      speak with him, as soon as the consultation was over; determined, however,
      to make that request no more if he was as shy of giving information as Dr.
      Warren,<span class="pagenum">251</span><a name="link251" id="link251"></a>
      poor Mr. de Luc was with me when he came; but it was necessary I should
      see Sir Lucas alone, that I might have a better claim upon his discretion:
      nevertheless I feared he would have left me, without the smallest
      intelligence, before I was able to make my worthy, but most slow companion
      comprehend the necessity of his absence.

      The moment we were alone, Sir Lucas opened upon the subject in the most
      comfortable manner. He assured me there was nothing desponding in the
      case, and that his royal patient would certainly recover, though not
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst I was in the midst of the almost speechless joy with which I heard
      this said, and ready to kiss the very feet of Sir Lucas for words of such
      delight, a rap at my door made me open it to Mr. Fairly, who entered,
      saying, &ldquo;I must come to ask you how you do, though I have no good
      news to bring you; but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He then, with the utmost amaze, perceived Sir Lucas. In so very many
      visits he had constantly found me alone, that I really believe he had
      hardly thought it possible he should see me in any other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then talked over the poor king&rsquo;s situation, and Sir Lucas was
      very open and comforting. How many sad meetings have I had with him
      heretofore; first in the alarming attacks of poor Mr. Thrale, and next in
      the agonizing fluctuations of his unhappy widow!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Lucas wished to speak with me alone, as he had something he wanted,
      through me, to communicate to the queen; but as he saw Mr. Fairly not
      disposed to retire first, by his manner of saying &ldquo;Sir Lucas, you
      will find all the breakfast ready below stairs,&rdquo; he made his bow,
      and said he would see me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairly then informed me he was quite uneasy at the recluse life led by
      the queen and the princesses, and that he was anxious to prevail with them
      to take a little air, which must be absolutely necessary to their health.
      He was projecting a scheme for this purpose, which required the assistance
      of the Duke of York, and he left me, to confer upon it with his royal
      highness, promising to return and tell its success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Lucas soon came back, and then gave me such unequivocal assurances of
      the king&rsquo;s recovery, that the moment he left me I flew to demand a
      private audience of the queen, that I might relate such delightful
      prognostics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of York was with her, I waited in the passage,<span
      class="pagenum">252</span><a name="link252" id="link252"></a> where I met
      Lady Charlotte Finch, and tried what I could to instil into her mind the
      hopes I entertained: this, however, was not possible; a general
      despondency prevailed throughout the house, and Lady Charlotte was
      infected by it very deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length I gained admission and gave my account, which was most meekly
      received by the most patient of sorrowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night came Mr. Fairly again; but, before he entered into any narrations
      he asked &ldquo;DO you expect Sir Lucas?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he had been already.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him rise early from table,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and I
      thought he was coming to YOU.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He has taken no fancy to poor Sir Lucas, and would rather, apparently,
      avoid meeting him. However, it is to me so essential a comfort to hear his
      opinions, that I have earnestly entreated to see him by every opportunity.

    <h2>
      FURTHER CHANGES AT THE LODGE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The equerries now had their own table as usual, to which the physicians
      were regularly invited, downstairs, and our eating-party was restored. The
      princes established a table of their own at the Castle, to which they gave
      daily invitations to such as they chose, from time to time, to select from
      the Lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of so large a party just under the apartment of the queen
      occasioned this new regulation, which took place by her majesty&rsquo;s
      own direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov. 20.&mdash;Poor Miss Goldsworthy was now quite ill, and forced to
      retire and nurse. No wonder, for she had suffered the worst sort of
      fatigue, that of fearing to sleep, from the apprehension the queen might
      speak, and want her. Lady Elizabeth Waldegrave now took her place Of
      sleeping in the queen&rsquo;s room, but the office of going for early
      intelligence how his majesty had passed the night devolved upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly at seven o&rsquo;clock I now went to the queen&rsquo;s apartment&mdash;Lady
      Elizabeth then rose and went to her own room to dress, and I received the
      queen&rsquo;s commands for my inquiries. I could not, however, go myself
      into the room where they assembled, which Miss Goldsworthy, who always
      applied to her brother, had very properly done: I sent in a message to beg
      to speak with General Budé, or whoever could bring an account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Charles Hawkins came; he had sat up. O, how terrible a narrative did
      he drily give of the night!&mdash;short, abrupt,<span class="pagenum">253</span><a
      name="link253" id="link253"></a> peremptorily bad, and indubitably
      hopeless! I did not dare alter, but I greatly softened this relation, in
      giving it to my poor queen. I had been, indeed, too much shocked by the
      hard way in which I had been told it, to deliver it in the same manner;
      neither did I, in my own heart, despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw Sir Lucas afterwards, who encouraged all my more sanguine opinions.
      He told me many new regulations had been made. His majesty was to be kept
      as quiet as possible, and see only physicians, except for a short and
      stated period in every day, during which he might summon such among his
      gentlemen as he pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairly came also early, and wrote and read letters of great
      consequence relative to the situation of affairs; and he told me he was
      then to go to the king, who had refused his assent to the new plan, and
      insisted upon seeing him when he came in from his ride, which, to keep him
      a little longer quiet, they had made him believe he was then taking. The
      gentlemen had agreed to be within call alternately, and he meant to have
      his own turn always in the forenoon, that his evenings might have some
      chance for quiet, The rest of the day was comfortless; my coadjutrix was
      now grown so fretful and affronting that, though we only met at dinner, it
      was hard to support her most unprovoked harshness.

    <h2>
      MR. FAIRLY AND THE LEARNED LADIES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At night, while I was just sealing a short note to my dear Miss Cambridge,
      who had an anxiety like that of my own Susan and Fredy lest I should
      suffer from my present fatigues, I heard the softest tap at my door,
      which, before I could either put down my letter or speak, was suddenly but
      most gently opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned about and saw a figure wrapped up in a great, coat, with boots
      and a hat on, who cautiously entered, and instantly closed the door. I
      stared, and looked very hard, but the face was much hid by the muffling of
      the high collar to the great coat. I wondered, and could not conceive who
      it could be. The figure then took off his hat and bowed, but he did not
      advance, and the light was away from him. I courtsied, and wondered more,
      and then a surprised voice exclaimed, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;
      and I found it was Mr. Fairly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;stop now, but I will come again;
      however, you know it, perhaps, already?<span class="pagenum">254</span><a
      name="link254" id="link254"></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;the&mdash;news.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;that the king is much better, and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir Lucas said so, but I have seen nobody since.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? And have you heard nothing more?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all; I cannot guess what you mean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, have not you heard&mdash;how much the king has talked?
      And&mdash;and have not you heard the charge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have heard not a word of any charge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A long preamble, uttered very rapidly, of &ldquo;how much the king had
      been talking,&rdquo; seemed less necessary to introduce his intelligence
      than to give him time to arrange it; and I was so much struck with this,
      that I could not even listen to him, from impatience to have him proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, however, breaking off, evidently from not knowing how to go on,
      he exclaimed, &ldquo;Well, I shall tell it you all by and by; you come in
      for your share!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost breathless now with amaze, I could hardly cry,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; cried he; but again he stopped,
      and, hesitatingly, said, &ldquo;You&mdash;you won&rsquo;t be angry?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered, still more amazed, and even almost
      terrified, at what I had now to expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; cried he, instantly resuming his first gay and
      rapid manner, &ldquo;the king has been calling them all to order for
      staying so long away from him. &lsquo;All the equerries and gentlemen
      here,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;lost their whole time at the table, by
      drinking so much wine and sitting so long over their bottle, which
      constantly made them all so slow in returning to their waiting, that when
      he wanted them in the afternoon they were never ready; and-and-and Mr.
      Fairly,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;is as bad as any of them; not that he stays
      so long at table, or is so fond of wine, but he&rsquo;s just as late as
      the rest; for he&rsquo;s so fond of the company of learned ladies, that he
      gets to the tea-table with Miss Burney, and there he stays and spends his
      whole time.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke all this like the velocity of lightning but, had it been with the
      most prosing slowness, I had surely never interrupted him, so vexed I was,
      so surprised, so completely disconcerted. Finding me silent, he began
      again, and as rapidly as ever; &ldquo;I know exactly,&rdquo; he cried,
      &ldquo;what it all means&mdash;what<span class="pagenum">255</span><a
      name="link255" id="link255"></a> the king has in his head&mdash;exactly
      what has given rise to the idea&mdash;&rsquo;tis Miss Fuzilier.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, indeed, I stared afresh, little expecting to hear her named by him.
      He went on in too much hurry for me to recollect his precise words, but he
      spoke of her very highly, and mentioned her learning, her education, and
      her acquirements, with great praise, yet with that sort of general
      commendation that disclaims all peculiar interest; and then, with some
      degree of displeasure mixed in his voice, mentioned the report that had
      been spread concerning them, and its having reached the ears of the king
      before his Illness. He then lightly added something I could not completely
      hear, of its utter falsehood, in a way that seemed to hold even a
      disavowal too important for it, and then concluded with saying, &ldquo;And
      this in the present confused state of his mind is altogether, I know, what
      he means by the learned ladies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had done he looked earnestly for my answer, but finding I made
      none, he said, with some concern, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t think any more of
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered, rather faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a lighter manner then, as if to treat the whole as too light for a
      thought, he said, as he was leaving the room to change his dress, &ldquo;Well,
      since I have now got the character of being so fond of such company, I
      shall certainly&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped short, evidently at a loss how to
      go on; but quickly after, with a laugh, he hastily added, &ldquo;come and
      drink tea with you very often;&rdquo; and then, with another laugh, which
      he had all to himself, he hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left me, however, enough to think upon and the predominant thought was
      an immediate doubt whether or not, since his visits had reached the king,
      his majesty&rsquo;s observation upon them ought to stop their continuance?
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the whole, however, when I summed up all, I found not cause
      sufficient for any change of system. No raillery had passed upon me; and,
      for him, he had stoutly evinced a determined contempt of it. Nothing of
      flirtation had been mentioned for either; I had merely been called a
      learned lady, and he had merely been accused Of liking such company. I had
      no other social comfort left me but Mr. Fairly, and I had discomforts past
      all description or suggestion. Should I drive him from me, what would pay
      me, and how had he deserved it? and which way could it be worth while? His
      friendship offered me a solace without hazard; it was held out to me <span
      class="pagenum">256</span><a name="link256" id="link256"></a> when all
      else was denied me; banished from every friend, confined almost to a state
      of captivity, harrowed to the very soul with surrounding afflictions, and
      without a glimpse of light as to when or how all might terminate, it
      seemed to me, in this situation, that providence had benignly sent in my
      way a character of so much worth and excellence, to soften the rigour of
      my condition, by kind sympathy and most honourable confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea was sufficient; and I thence determined to follow as he led, in
      disdaining any further notice, or even remembrance, if possible, of this
      learned accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov. 21.&mdash;All went better and better to-day, and I received from the
      king&rsquo;s room a more cheering account to carry to my poor queen. We
      had now hopes of a speedy restoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king held long conferences with all his gentlemen, and, though far
      from composed, was so frequently rational as to make any resistance to his
      will nearly impossible. Innumerable difficulties attended this state, but
      the general promise it gave of a complete recovery recompensed them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Lucas Pepys came to me in the morning and acquainted me with the
      rising hopes of amendment. But he disapproved the admission of so many
      gentlemen, and would have limited the license to only the equerry in
      waiting, Colonel Goldsworthy, and Mr. Fairly, who was now principal
      throughout the house, in universal trust for his superior judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, Sir Lucas said, now talked of everybody and everything he could
      recollect or suggest.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I have heard, thought I.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, presently after, he added, &ldquo;No one escapes; you will have your
      turn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Frightened lest he knew I had had it, I eagerly exclaimed, &ldquo;O, no; I
      hope not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; cried he, good-humouredly; &ldquo;what need you
      care? He can say no harm of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I ventured then to ask if yet I had been named? He believed not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      This doubled my curiosity to know to whom the &ldquo;learned ladies&rdquo;
      had been mentioned, and whether to Mr. Fairly himself, or to someone who
      related it; I think the latter, but there is no way to inquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very early in the evening I heard a rap at my door. I was in my inner
      room, and called out, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; The door opened and
      Mr. Fairly appeared.<span class="pagenum">257</span><a name="link257"
      id="link257"></a> He had been so long in attendance this morning with our
      poor sick monarch, that he was too much fatigued to join the dinner-party.
      He had stood five hours running, besides the concomitant circumstances of
      attention. He had instantly laid down when he procured his dismission, and
      had only risen to eat some cold chicken before he came to my room. During
      that repast he had again been demanded, but he charged the gentleman to
      make his excuse, as he could go through nothing further.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope the king did not conclude him again with the learned; this was the
      most serene, and even cheerful evening, I had passed since the poor king&rsquo;s
      first seizure.

    <h2>
      REPORTS ON THE KING&rsquo;S CONDITION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nov. 22.&mdash;When I went for my morning inquiries, Colonel Manners came
      out to me. He could give me no precise account, as the sitters-up had not
      yet left the king, but he feared the night had been bad. We mutually
      bewailed the mournful state of the house. He is a very good creature at
      heart, though as unformed as if he had just left Eton or Westminster. But
      he loves his master with a true and faithful heart, and is almost as ready
      to die as to live for him, if any service of that risk was proposed to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the queen&rsquo;s hair was dressing, though only for a close cap, I
      was sent again. Colonel Manners came out to me, and begged I would enter
      the music-room, as Mr. Keate, the surgeon, had now just left the king, and
      was waiting to give me an account before he laid down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found him in his night-cap: he took me up to a window, and gave me but a
      dismal history: the night had been very unfavourable, and the late
      amendment very transient. I heard nothing further till the evening, when
      my constant companion came to me. All, he said, was bad: he had been
      summoned and detained nearly all the morning, and had then rode to St.
      Leonard&rsquo;s to get a little rest, as he would not return till after
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had but just begun his tea when his name was called aloud in the
      passage: up he started, seized his hat, and with a hasty bow, decamped. I
      fancy it was one of the princes; and the more, as he did not come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday, Nov. 23.&mdash;A sad day this! I was sent as usual for<span
      class="pagenum">258</span><a name="link258" id="link258"></a> the night
      account, which I had given to me by Mr. Fairly, and a very dismal one
      indeed. Yet I never, upon this point, yield implicitly to his opinion, as
      I see him frequently of the despairing side, and as for myself, I thank
      God, my hopes never wholly fall. A certain faith in his final recovery has
      uniformly supported my spirits from the beginning...
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, a small tap at my door, with, &ldquo;Here I am again,&rdquo;
      ushered in Mr. Fairly. He seemed much hurried and disturbed, and innately
      uncomfortable; and very soon he entered into a detail of the situation of
      affairs that saddened me in the extreme. The poor king was very ill
      indeed, and so little aware of his own condition, that he would submit to
      no rule, and chose to have company with him from morning till night,
      sending out for the gentlemen one after another without intermission, and
      chiefly for Mr. Fairly, who, conscious it was hurtful to his majesty, and
      nearly worn out himself, had now no chance of respite or escape but by
      leaving the house and riding out....
    </p>
    <p>
      I have never seen him so wearied, or so vexed, I know not which. &ldquo;How
      shall I rejoice,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;when all this is over, and I can
      turn my back to this scene!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I should rejoice, I said, for him when he could make his escape; but his
      use here, in the whole round, is infinite; almost nothing is done without
      consulting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he cried, while he was making some memorandums,
      &ldquo;I could live without sleep; I know not now how to spare my night.&rdquo;
      He then explained to me various miscellaneous matters of occupation, and
      confessed himself forced to break from the confused scene of action as
      much as possible, where the tumult and bustle were as overpowering, as the
      affliction, in the more quiet apartments, was dejecting. Then, by
      implication, what credit did he not give to my Poor still room, which he
      made me understand was his only refuge and consolation in this miserable
      house!

    <h2>
      MR. FAIRLY THINKS THE KING NEEDS STRICTER MANAGEMENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nov. 24.&mdash;Very bad again was the night&rsquo;s account, which I
      received at seven o&rsquo;clock this morning from Mr. Dundas. I returned
      with it to my Poor royal mistress, who heard it with her usual patience.<span
      class="pagenum">259</span><a name="link259" id="link259"></a> While I was
      still with her, Lady Elizabeth came with a request from Mr. Fairly, for an
      audience before her majesty&rsquo;s breakfast. As soon as she was ready
      she ordered me to tell Lady Elizabeth to bring him....
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after,&mdash;with a hasty rap, came Mr. Fairly. He brought his
      writing to my table, where I was trying to take off impressions of plants.
      I Saw he meant to read me his letter; but before he had finished it Lady
      Charlotte Finch came in search of him. It was not for the queen, but
      herself; she wished to speak and consult with him upon the king&rsquo;s
      seeing his children, which was now his vehement demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was writing for one of the king&rsquo;s messengers, and could not stop
      till he had done. Poor Lady Charlotte, overcome with tenderness and
      compassion, wept the whole time he was at his pen; and when he had put it
      down, earnestly remonstrated on the cruelty of the present regulations,
      which debarred his majesty the sight of the princesses. I joined with her,
      though more firmly, believe me; my tears I suppress for my solitude. I
      have enough of that to give them vent, and, with all my suppression, my
      poor aching eyes can frequently scarce see one object from another.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Fairly left off writing he entered very deeply into argument with
      Lady Charlotte. He was averse to her request; he explained the absolute
      necessity of strong measures, and of the denial of dangerous indulgences,
      while the poor king was in this wretched state. The disease, he said, was
      augmented by every agitation, and the discipline of forced quiet was
      necessary till he was capable of some reflection. At present he spoke
      everything that occurred to him, and in a manner so wild, unreasonable,
      and dangerous, with regard to future constructions, that there could be no
      kindness so great to him as to suffer him only to see those who were his
      requisite attendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then enumerated many instances very forcibly, in which he showed how
      much more properly his majesty might have been treated, by greater
      strength of steadiness in his management. He told various facts which
      neither of us had heard, and, at last, in speaking of the most recent
      occurrences, he fell into a narrative relating to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, he said, had almost continually demanded him of late, and with
      the most extreme agitation; he had been as much with him as it was
      possible for his health to bear. &ldquo;Five hours,&rdquo; continued he,
      &ldquo;I spent with him on Friday, and four<span class="pagenum">260</span><a
      name="link260" id="link260"></a> on Saturday, and three and a half
      yesterday; yet the moment I went to him last night, he accused me of never
      coming near him. He said I gave him up entirely; that I was always going
      out, always dining out, always going to Mrs. Harcourt&rsquo;s&mdash;riding
      to St. Leonard&rsquo;s; but he knew why&mdash;&rsquo;twas to meet Miss
      Fuzilier.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Lady Charlotte was answered, and, looking extremely sorry, went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then read me his messenger&rsquo;s letter. &lsquo;Twas upon a very
      delicate affair, relative to the Prince of Wales, in whose service, he
      told me, he first began his Court preferment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had made up his packet he returned to the subject of the king&rsquo;s
      rage, with still greater openness. He had attacked him, he said, more
      violently than ever about Miss Fuzilier which, certainly, as there had
      been such a report, was very unpleasant. &ldquo;And when I seriously
      assured him,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that there was nothing in it, he said
      &lsquo;I had made him the happiest of men.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov. 25.&mdash;&mdash;My morning account was from General Bud, and a very
      despairing one. He has not a ray of hope for better days.
    </p>
    <p>
      My poor queen was so much pleased with a sort of hymn for the king, which
      she had been reading In the newspapers, that I scrupled not to tell her of
      one in manuscript, which, of course, she desired to read; but I stipulated
      for its return, though I could not possibly stay in the room while she
      looked at it.

    <h2>
      MR. FAIRLY WANTS A CHANGE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the evening Mr. Fairly came, entering with a most gently civil
      exclamation of &ldquo;How long it is since I have seen you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not answer, it was only one evening missed; for, in truth, a day
      at this time seems liberally a week, and a very slow one too. He had been
      to town, suddenly sent by the queen last night, and had returned only at
      noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave me a full account of all that was passing and projecting; and
      awfully critical everything seemed. &ldquo;He should now soon,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;quit the tragic scene, and go to relax and recruit, with his
      children, in the country. He regarded his service here as nearly over,
      since an entirely new regulation was planning, in which the poor king was
      no longer to be allowed the sight of any of his gentlemen. His continual
      long conversations with them were judged utterly improper, and<span
      class="pagenum">261</span><a name="link261" id="link261"></a> he was only
      to be attended by the medical people and his pages.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He then gave into my hands the office of hinting to the queen his
      intention, if he could be dispensed with by her majesty, to go into the
      Country on the 12th of next month (December), with his boy Charles, who
      then left Eton for the Christmas holidays. I knew this would be unwelcome
      intelligence, but I wished to forward his departure, and would not refuse
      the commission. When this was settled he said he would go and take a
      circuit, and see how matters stood; and then, if he could get away after
      showing himself, return&mdash;if I would give him leave to drink his tea
      with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been gone ten minutes before Lady Charlotte came in search of
      him. She had been told, she said, that he was with me. I laughed, but
      could not forbear asking if I passed for his keeper, since whenever he was
      missing I was always called to account for him. Again, however, he came
      and drank his tea, and stayed an hour, in most confidential discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the new regulation is established, only one gentleman is to remain&mdash;which
      will be the equerry in waiting. This is now Colonel Goldsworthy. The rest
      will disperse.

    <h2>
      REMOVAL OF THE KING TO KEW DETERMINED UPON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nov. 26.&mdash;I found we were all speedily to remove to Kew. This was to
      be kept profoundly secret till almost the moment of departure. The king
      will never consent to quit Windsor and to allure him away by some
      stratagem occupies all the physicians, who have proposed and enforced this
      measure. Mr. Fairly is averse to it: the king&rsquo;s repugnance he thinks
      insurmountable, and that it ought not to be opposed. But the princes take
      part with the physicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left me to ride out, but more cordial and with greater simplicity of
      kindness than ever, he smilingly said in going, &ldquo;Well, good bye, and
      God bless you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; quoth I, after he had shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov. 27.&mdash;This morning and whole day were dreadful My early account
      was given me by Mr. Charles Hawkins, and with such determined decision of
      incurability, that I left him quite in horror. All that I dared, I
      softened to my poor queen, who was now harassed to death with state
      affairs, and impending storms of state dissensions, I would have given<span
      class="pagenum">262</span><a name="link262" id="link262"></a> the world to
      have spent the whole day by her side, and poured in what balm of hope I
      could, since it appeared but too Visibly she scarce received a ray from
      any other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Universal despondence now pervaded the whole house. Sir Lucas, indeed,
      sustained his original good opinion, but he was nearly overpowered by
      standing alone, and was forced to let the stream take its course with but
      little opposition. Even poor Mr. de Luc was silenced; Miss Planta easily
      yields to fear; and Mrs. Schwellenberg&mdash;who thinks it treason to say
      the king is ever at all indisposed&mdash;not being able to say all was
      quite well, forbade a single word being uttered upon the subject The
      dinners, therefore, became a time of extremest pain; all was ignorance,
      mystery, and trembling expectation of evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, thank heaven! came again my sole relief, Mr. Fairly. He
      brought his son, and they entered with such serene aspects, that I soon
      shook off a little of my gloom; and I heard there was no new cause, for
      though all was bad, nothing was worse. We talked over everything; and that
      always opens the mind, and softens the bitterness of sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prospect before us, with respect to Kew, is indeed terrible. There is
      to be a total seclusion from all but those within the walls, and those are
      to be contracted to merely necessary attendants. Mr. Fairly disapproved
      the scheme, though a gainer by it of leisure and liberty. Only the equerry
      in waiting Is to have a room in the house; the rest of the gentlemen are
      to take their leave. He meant, therefore, himself, to go into the country
      with all speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov. 28.&mdash;How woful-how bitter a day, in every part, was this!
    </p>
    <p>
      My early account was from the king&rsquo;s page, Mr. Stillingfleet, and
      the night had been extremely bad. I dared not sink the truth to my poor
      queen, though I mixed in it whatever I Could devise of cheer and hope; and
      she bore it with the most wonderful calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Addington was now called in: a very old physician, but peculiarly
      experienced in disorders such as afflicted our poor king, though not
      professedly a practitioner in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Lucas made me a visit, and informed me of all the medical proceedings;
      and told me, in confidence, we were to go to Kew to-morrow, though the
      queen herself had not yet concurred in the measure; but the physicians
      joined to desire<span class="pagenum">263</span><a name="link263"
      id="link263"></a> it, and they were supported by the princes. The
      difficulty how to get the king away from his favourite abode was all that
      rested. If they even attempted force, they had not a doubt but his
      smallest resistance would call up the whole country to his fancied rescue!
      Yet how, at such a time, prevail by persuasion?
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved me even to tears, by telling me that none of their own lives
      would be safe if the king did not recover so Prodigiously high ran the
      tide of affection and loyalty. All the physicians received threatening
      letters daily to answer for the safety of their monarch with their lives!
      Sir George Baker had already been Stopped in his carriage by the mob to
      give an account of the king; and when he said it Was a bad one, they had
      furiously exclaimed, &ldquo;The more shame for you!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A PRIVY COUNCIL HELD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After he left me, a privy council was held at the Castle, with the Prince
      of Wales; the chancellor,<a href="#linknote-300" name="linknoteref-300"
      id="linknoteref-300"><small>300</small></a> Mr. Pitt, and all the officers
      of state were summoned, to sign a Permission for the king&rsquo;s removal.
      The poor queen gave an audience to the chancellor&mdash;it was necessary
      to sanctify their proceedings. The princess royal and Lady Courtown
      attended her. It was a tragedy the most dismal!
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen&rsquo;s knowledge of the king&rsquo;s aversion to Kew made her
      consent to this measure with the extremest reluctance yet it was not to be
      opposed: It Was stated as much the best for him, on account of the garden:
      as here there is none but what Is Public to spectators from the terrace or
      tops of houses. I believe they were perfectly right though the removal was
      so tremendous. The physicians were summoned to the privy Council, to give
      their Opinions, upon oath, that this step was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inexpressible was the alarm of everyone, lest the king, if he recovered,
      should bear a lasting resentment against the authors and promoters of this
      Journey. To give it, therefore, every possible sanction it was decreed
      that he should be seen, both by the chancellor and Mr. Pitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chancellor went in to his presence with a tremor such as, before, he
      had been only accustomed to inspire; and when he came out, he was so
      extremely affected by the state in which he<span class="pagenum">264</span><a
      name="link264" id="link264"></a> saw his royal master and patron that the
      tears ran down his cheeks, and his feet had difficulty to support him. Mr.
      Pitt was more composed, but expressed his grief with so much respect and
      attachment, that it added new weight to the universal admiration with
      which he is here beheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these circumstances, with various others, of equal sadness which I
      must not relate, came to my knowledge from Sir Lucas, Mr. de Luc, and my
      noon attendance upon her majesty, who was compelled to dress for her
      audience of the chancellor. And, altogether, with the horror of the next
      day&rsquo;s removal, and the gloom of the ensuing Kew residence, I was so
      powerfully depressed, that when Mr. Fairly came in the evening, not all my
      earnestness to support my firmness could re-animate me, and I gave him a
      most solemn reception, and made the tea directly, and almost in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He endeavoured, at first, to revive me by enlivening discourse, but
      finding that fail, he had recourse to more serious means. He began his
      former favourite topic-the miseries of life-the inherent miseries, he
      thinks them, to which we are so universally born and bred, that it was as
      much consonant with our reason to expect as with our duty to support them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard him with that respect his subject and his character alike merited;
      but I could not answer&mdash;my heart was sunk&mdash;my spirits were all
      exhausted: I knew not what to expect next, nor how I might be enabled to
      wade through the dreadful winter....
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not, I saw, one ray of hope to offer me of better times, yet he
      recommended me to cheer myself; but not by more sanguine expectations&mdash;simply
      and solely by religion. To submit, he said, to pray and to submit, were
      all we had to do....
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the Prince of Wales, in the passage, carried him away. They
      remained together, in deep conference, all the rest of the evening,
      consulting upon measures for facilitating the king&rsquo;s removal, and
      obtaining his consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went very late to the queen, and found her in deep sorrow but nothing
      confidential passed: I found her not alone, nor alone did I leave her. But
      I knew what was passing in her mind&mdash;the removing the king!-Its
      difficulty and danger at present, and the dread of his permanent
      indignation hereafter.<span class="pagenum">265</span><a name="link265"
      id="link265"></a> THE REMOVAL To KEW.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov. 29.&mdash;Shall I ever forget the varied emotions of this dreadful
      day! I rose with the heaviest of hearts, and found my poor royal mistress
      in the deepest dejection: she told me now of our intended expedition to
      Kew. Lady Elizabeth hastened away to dress, and I was alone with her for
      some time. Her mind, she said, quite misgave her about Kew: the king&rsquo;s
      dislike was terrible to think of, and she could not foresee in what it
      might end. She would have resisted the measure herself, but that she had
      determined not to have upon her own mind any opposition to the opinion of
      the physicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      The account of the night was still more and more discouraging: it was
      related to me by one of the pages, Mr. Brawan; and though a little I
      softened or omitted particulars, I yet most sorrowfully conveyed it to the
      queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terrible was the morning!&mdash;uninterruptedly terrible! all spent in
      hasty packing up, preparing for we knew not what, nor for how long, nor
      with what circumstances, nor scarcely with what view! We seemed preparing
      for captivity, without having committed any offence; and for banishment,
      without the least conjecture when we might be recalled from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor queen was to get off in private: the plan settled, between the
      princes and the physicians, was, that her majesty and the princesses
      should go away quietly, and then that the king should be told that they
      were gone, which was the sole method they could devise to prevail with him
      to follow. He was then to be allured by a promise of seeing them at Kew
      again, as they knew he would doubt their assertion, he was to go through
      the rooms and examine the house himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe it was about ten o&rsquo;clock when her majesty departed drowned
      in tears, she glided along the passage, and got softly into her carriage,
      with two weeping princesses, and Lady Courtown, who was to be her
      lady-in-waiting during this dreadful residence. Then followed the third
      princess, With Lady Charlotte Finch. They went off without any state or
      parade, and a more melancholy Scene cannot be imagined. There was not a
      dry eye in the house. The footmen, the house-maids, the porter, the
      sentinels&mdash;all cried even bitterly as they looked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three younger princesses were to wait till the event was known. Lady
      Elizabeth Waldegrave and Miss Goldsworthy had their royal highnesses in
      charge,<span class="pagenum">266</span><a name="link266" id="link266"></a>
      It was settled the king was to be attended by three of his gentlemen, in
      the carriage, and to be followed by the physicians, and preceded by his
      pages. But all were to depart on his arrival at Kew, except his own
      equerry-in-waiting. It Was not very pleasant to these gentlemen to attend
      his majesty at such a time, and upon such a plan, so adverse to his
      inclination, without any power of assistance: however, they would rather
      have died than refused, and it was certain the king would no other way
      travel but by compulsion, which no human being dared even mention. Miss
      Planta and I were to go as soon as the packages could be ready, with some
      of the queen&rsquo;s things. Mrs. Schwellenberg was to remain behind, for
      one day, in order to make arrangements about the jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what a confusion was the house! Princes, equerries, physicians, pages&mdash;all
      conferring, whispering, plotting, and caballing, how to induce the king to
      set off!
    </p>
    <p>
      At length we found an opportunity to glide through the passage to the
      coach; Miss Planta and myself, with her maid and Goter. But the heaviness
      of heart with which we began this journey, and the dreadful prognostics of
      the duration of misery to which it led us&mdash;who can tell?
    </p>
    <p>
      We were almost wholly silent all the way. When we arrived at Kew, we found
      the suspense with which the king was awaited truly terrible. Her majesty
      had determined to return to Windsor at night, if he came not. We were all
      to forbear unpacking in the mean while.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was all now regulated by express order of the Prince of Wales,
      who rode over first, and arranged all the apartments, and writ, with
      chalk, the names of the destined inhabitants on each door. My own room he
      had given to Lady Courtown; and for me, he had fixed on one immediately
      adjoining to Mrs. Schwellenberg&rsquo;s; a very pleasant room, looking
      into the garden, but by everybody avoided, because the partition is so
      thin of the next apartment, that not a word can be spoken in either that
      is not heard in both.

      A MYSTERIOUS VISITOR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While I was surveying this new habitation, the princess royal came into
      it, and, with a cheered countenance, told me that the queen had just
      received intelligence that the king was rather better, and would come
      directly, and therefore I was<span class="pagenum">267</span><a
      name="link267" id="link267"></a> commissioned to issue orders to Columb to
      keep out of sight, and to see that none of the servants were in the way
      when the king passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eagerly, and enlivened, downstairs I hastened, to speak to Columb. I flew
      to the parlour to ring the bell for him, as In my new room I had no bell
      for either man or maid; but judge my surprise, when, upon opening the
      door, and almost rushing in, I perceived a Windsor uniform! I was
      retreating with equal haste, when the figure before me started, in so
      theatric an attitude of astonishment, that it forced me to look again. The
      arms were then wide opened, while the figure fell back, in tragic paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much at a loss, and unable to distinguish the face, I was again retiring,
      when the figure advanced, but in such measured steps as might have suited
      a march upon a stage. I now suspected it was Mr. Fairly; yet so unlikely I
      thought it, I could not believe it without speech. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; I
      cried, &ldquo;it is not&mdash;it is not&mdash;&rdquo; I stopped, afraid to
      make a mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      With arms yet more sublimed, he only advanced, in silence and dumb
      heroics. I now ventured to look more steadily at the face, and then to
      exclaim:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Mr. Fairly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The laugh now betrayed him: he could hardly believe I had really not known
      him. I explained that my very little expectation of seeing him at Kew had
      assisted my near-sightedness to perplex me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was glad to see him so sportive, which I found was Owing to the good
      spirits of bringing good news; he had mounted his horse as soon as he had
      heard the king had consented to the journey, and he had galloped to Kew,
      to acquaint her majesty with the welcome tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rang and gave my orders to Columb and he then begged me not to hurry
      away, and to give him leave to wait, in this parlour, the king&rsquo;s
      arrival. He then explained to me the whole of the intended proceedings and
      arrangements, with details innumerable and most interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He meant to go almost immediately into the country&mdash;all was settled
      with the queen. I told him I was most cordially glad his recruit was so
      near at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall, however,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;be in town a few days
      longer, and come hither constantly to pay you all a little visit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta then appeared. A more general conversation now took place,
      though in its course Mr. Fairly had the malice to give me a start I little
      expected from him. We were talk-<span class="pagenum">268</span><a
      name="link268" id="link268"></a> ing of our poor king, and wondering at
      the delay of his arrival, when Mr. Fairly said, &ldquo;The king now, Miss
      Planta, mentions everybody and everything that he knows or has heard
      mentioned in his whole life. Pray does he know any Of your secrets? he&rsquo;ll
      surely tell them if he does!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I hear,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure he can&rsquo;t
      tell anything of Me! But I wonder what he says of everybody?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, everything,&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Have you not heard of
      yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, no! Dear me, Mr. Fairly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, dear Miss Planta! why should not you have your share? Have you
      not heard he spares nobody?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have; but I can&rsquo;t think what he says of them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fearful of anything more, I arose and looked at the Window to see if any
      sign of approach appeared, but he dropped the subject without coming any
      nearer, and Miss Planta dropped it too.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe he wished to discover if she had heard of his learned ladies!

    <h2>
      THE KING&rsquo;S ARRIVAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dinner went on, and still no king. We now began to grow very anxious, when
      Miss Planta exclaimed that she thought she heard a carriage. We all
      listened. &ldquo;I hope!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I see you do!&rdquo; cried
      he, &ldquo;you have a very face of hope at this moment!&rdquo;&mdash;and
      it was not disappointed. The sound came nearer, and presently a carriage
      drove into the front court. I could see nothing, it was so dark; but I
      presently heard the much-respected voice of the dear unhappy king,
      speaking rapidly to the porter, as he alighted from the coach. Mr. Fairly
      flew instantly upstairs, to acquaint the queen with the welcome tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor king had been prevailed upon to quit Windsor with the utmost
      difficulty: he was accompanied by General Harcourt, his aide-de-camp, and
      Colonels Goldsworthy and Wellbred&mdash;no one else! He had passed all the
      rest with apparent composure, to come to his carriage, for they lined the
      passage, eager to see him once more! and almost all Windsor was collected
      round the rails, etc. to witness the mournful spectacle of his departure,
      which left them in the deepest despondence, with scarce a ray of hope ever
      to see him again.<span class="pagenum">269</span><a name="link269"
      id="link269"></a> The bribery, however, which brought, was denied him!&mdash;he
      was by no means to see the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went to her at night, she was all graciousness, and kept me till
      very late. I had not seen her alone so long, except for a few minutes in
      the morning, that I had a thousand things I wished to say to her. You may
      be sure they were all, as far as they went, consolatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Princess Augusta had a small tent-bed put up in the queen&rsquo;s
      bed-chamber: I called her royal highness when the queen dismissed me. She
      undressed in an adjoining apartment.

    <h2>
      THE ARRANGEMENTS AT KEW PALACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I must now tell you how the house is disposed. The whole of the
      ground-floor that looks towards the &lsquo;garden is appropriated to the
      king, though he is not indulged with its range. In the side wing is a room
      for the physicians, destined to their consultations; adjoining to that is
      the equerry&rsquo;s dining-room. Mrs. Schwellenberg&rsquo;s parlours,
      which are in the front of the house, one for dining, the other for coffee
      and tea, are still allowed us. The other front rooms below are for the
      pages to dine, and the rest of the more detached buildings are for the
      servants of various sorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the rooms immediately over those which are actually occupied by the
      king are locked up; her majesty relinquishes them, that he may never be
      tantalized by footsteps overhead. She has retained only the bed-room, the
      drawing-room, which joins to it, and the gallery, in which she eats.
      Beyond this gallery are the apartments of the three elder princesses, in
      one of which rooms Miss Planta sleeps. There is nothing more on the first
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second a very large room for Mrs. Schwellenberg, and a very
      pleasant one for myself, are over the queen&rsquo;s rooms. Farther on are
      three bed-rooms, one for the surgeon or apothecary in waiting, the next
      for the equerry, and the third, lately mine, for the queen&rsquo;s lady&mdash;all
      written thus with chalk by the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then follows a very long dark passage, with little bed-rooms on each side,
      for the maids, and one of the pages. These look like so many little cells
      of a convent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sandys has a room nearer the queen&rsquo;s, and Goter has one nearer
      to mine. At the end of this passage there is a larger room, formerly
      appropriated to Mr. de Luc, but now<span class="pagenum">270</span><a
      name="link270" id="link270"></a> chalked &ldquo;The physicians&rsquo;.&rdquo;
      One physician, one equerry, and one surgeon or apothecary, are regularly
      to sleep in the house. This is the general arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince very properly has also ordered that one of his majesty&rsquo;s
      grooms of&rsquo; the bedchamber should be in constant waiting; he is to
      reside in the prince&rsquo;s house, over the way, which is also fitting up
      for some others. This gentleman is to receive all inquiries about the king&rsquo;s
      health. The same regulation had taken place at Windsor, in the Castle,
      where the gentlemen waited in turn. Though, as the physicians send their
      account to St. James&rsquo;s, this is now become an almost useless
      ceremony, for everybody goes thither to read the bulletin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three young princesses are to be in a house belonging to the king on
      Kew green, commonly called Princess Elizabeth&rsquo;s, as her royal
      highness has long inhabited it in her illness. There will lodge Miss
      Goldsworthy, Mlle. Montmoulin, and Miss Gomme. Lady Charlotte Finch is to
      be at the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not sleep all night&mdash;&mdash;I thought I heard the poor king.
      He was under the same range of apartments, though far distant, but his
      indignant disappointment haunted me. The queen, too, was very angry at
      having promises made in her name which could not be kept. What a day
      altogether was this!

    <h2>
      A REGENCY HINTED AT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sunday, Nov. 30.&mdash;Here, in all its dread colours, dark as its darkest
      prognostics, began the Kew campaign. I went to my poor queen at seven o&rsquo;clock:
      the Princess Augusta arose and went away to dress, and I received her
      majesty&rsquo;s commands to go down for inquiries. She had herself passed
      a wretched night, and already lamented leaving Windsor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited very long in the cold dark passages below, before I could find
      any one of whom to ask intelligence. The parlours were without fires, and
      washing. I gave directions afterwards, to have a fire in one of them by
      seven o&rsquo;clock every morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length I procured the speech of one of the pages, and heard that the
      night had been the most violently bad of any yet passed!&mdash;and no
      wonder!
    </p>
    <p>
      I hardly knew how to creep upstairs, frozen both within and without, to
      tell such news; but it was not received as if unexpected, and I omitted
      whatever was not essential to be known.<span class="pagenum">271</span><a
      name="link271" id="link271"></a> Afterwards arrived Mrs. Schwellenberg, so
      oppressed between her spasms and the house&rsquo;s horrors, that the
      oppression she inflicted ought perhaps to be pardoned. It was, however,
      difficult enough to bear! Harshness, tyranny, dissension, and even insult,
      seemed personified. I cut short details upon this subject&mdash;they would
      but make you sick....
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Miss Cambridge sent to me immediately. I saw she had a secret hope
      she might come and sit with me now and then in this confinement. It would
      have been my greatest possible solace in this dreary abode: but I hastened
      to acquaint her of the absolute seclusion, and even to beg she would not
      send her servant to the house for I found it was much desired to keep off
      all who might carry away any intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is ever most reasonable, and never thenceforward hinted upon the
      subject. But she wrote continually long letters, and filled with news and
      anecdotes of much interest, relating to anything she could gather of
      &ldquo;out-house proceedings,&rdquo; which now became very important&mdash;the
      length of the malady threatening a regency!&mdash;a word which I have not
      yet been able to articulate.

    <h2>
      MR. FAIRLY&rsquo;S KIND OFFICES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kew, Monday, Dec. 1.&mdash;Mournful was the opening of the month! My
      account of the night from Gezewell, the page, was very alarming, and my
      poor royal mistress began to sink more than I had ever yet seen. No
      wonder; the length of the malady so uncertain, the steps which seemed now
      requisite so shocking: for new advice, and such as suited only disorders
      that physicians in general relinquish, was now proposed, and compliance or
      refusal were almost equally tremendous.
    </p>
    <p>
      In sadness I returned from her, and, moping and unoccupied, I was walking
      up and down my room, when Columb came to say Mr. Fairly desired to know if
      I could see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, I said, I would come to him in the parlour. He was not at all
      well, nor did he seem at all comfortable. He had undertaken, by his own
      desire, to purchase small carpets for the princesses, for the house is in
      a state of cold and discomfort past all imagination. It has never been a
      winter residence, and there was nothing prepared for its becoming one. He
      could not, he told me, look at the rooms of their royal highnesses without
      shuddering for them; and he longed, he said, to cover all the naked, cold
      boards, to render them<span class="pagenum">272</span><a name="link272"
      id="link272"></a> more habitable. He had obtained permission to execute
      this as a commission: for so miserable is the house at present that no
      general orders to the proper people are either given Or thought about; and
      every one is so absorbed in the general calamity, that they would
      individually sooner perish than offer up complaint or petition. I Should
      never end were I to explain the reasons there are for both.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he must next, he said, effect, was supplying them with sand-bags for
      windows and doors, which he intended to fill and to place himself. The
      wind which blew in upon those lovely princesses, he declared, was enough
      to destroy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had informed me of these kind offices, he began an inquiry into
      how I was lodged. Well enough, I said; but he would not accept so general
      an answer. He insisted upon knowing what was my furniture, and in
      particular if I had any carpet; and when I owned I had none, he smiled,
      and said he would bring six, though his commission only extended to three.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not at all like the parlour, which, indeed, is wretchedly cold and
      miserable: he wished to bring it a carpet, and new fit it up with warm
      winter accommodations. He reminded me of my dearest Fredy, when she
      brought me a decanter of barley-water and a bright tin saucepan, under her
      hoop. I Could not tell him that history in detail, but I rewarded his
      good-nature by hinting at the resemblance it bore, in its active zeal, to
      my sweet Mrs. Locke....
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen afterwards presented me with a very pretty little new carpet;
      only a bed-side slip, but very warm. She knew not how much I was
      acquainted with its history, but I found she had settled for them all six.
      She gave another to Mrs. Schwellenberg.

    <h2>
      MRS. SCHWELLENBERG&rsquo;S PARLOUR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dec. 3.&mdash;Worse again to-day was the poor king: the little fair gleam,
      how soon did it pass away!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was beginning to grow ill myself, from the added fatigue of disturbance
      in the night, unavoidably occasioned by the neighbourhood to an invalid
      who summoned her maids at all hours; and my royal mistress issued orders
      for a removal to take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      My new apartment is at the end of the long dark passage mentioned, with
      bed-room cells on each side it. It is a<span class="pagenum">273</span><a
      name="link273" id="link273"></a> very comfortable room, carpeted all over,
      with one window looking to the front of the house and two into a
      court-yard. It is the most distant from the queen, but in all other
      respects is very desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must now relate briefly a new piece of cruelty. I happened to mention to
      la première présidente my waiting for a page to bring the morning
      accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where do you wait?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the parlour, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my parlour? Oh, ver well! I will see to that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no other place, ma&rsquo;am, but the cold passages, which,
      at that time in the morning, are commonly wet as well as dark.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, ver well! When everybody goes to my room I might keep an inn&mdash;what
      you call hotel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All good humour now again vanished; and this morning, when I made my seven
      o&rsquo;clock inquiry, I found the parlour doors both locked! I returned
      so shivering to my queen, that she demanded the cause, which I simply
      related; foreseeing inevitable destruction from continuing to run such a
      hazard. She instantly protested there should be a new arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dec. 4.&mdash;No opportunity offered yesterday for my better security, and
      therefore I was again exposed this morning to the cold dark damp of the
      miserable passage. The account was tolerable, but a threat of sore-throat
      accelerated the reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now settled that the dining-parlour should be made over for the
      officers of state who came upon business to the house, and who hitherto
      had waited in the hall; and the room which was next to Mrs. Schwellenberg&rsquo;s,
      and which had first been mine, was now made our salle à manger. By this
      means, the parlour being taken away for other people, and by command
      relinquished, I obtained once again the freedom of entering it, to &lsquo;gather
      my account for her majesty. But the excess of ill-will awakened by my
      obtaining this little privilege, which was actually necessary to my very
      life, was so great, that more of personal offence and harshness could not
      have been shown to the most guilty of culprits.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the pages acquainted me his majesty was not worse, and the night
      had been as usual. As usual, too, was my day sad and solitary all the
      morning&mdash;not solitary but worse during dinner and coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just after it, however, came the good and sweet Mr. Smelt.<span
      class="pagenum">274</span><a name="link274" id="link274"></a> The Prince
      of Wales sent for him, and condescended to apologise for the Windsor
      transaction, and to order he might regain admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      How this was brought about I am not clear: I only know it is agreed by all
      parties that the prince has the faculty of making his peace, where he
      wishes it, with the most captivating grace In the world.

    <h2>
      A NEW PHYSICIAN SUMMONED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairly told me this evening that Dr. Willis, a physician of Lincoln,
      of peculiar skill and practice in intellectual maladies, had been sent for
      by express. The poor queen had most painfully concurred in a measure which
      seemed to fix the nature of the king&rsquo;s attack in the face of the
      world; but the necessity and strong advice had prevailed over her
      repugnance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dec. 6.&mdash;Mr. Fairly came to me, to borrow pen and ink for a few
      memorandums. Notwithstanding much haste, he could not, he said, go till he
      had acquainted me with the opening of Dr. Willis with his royal patient. I
      told him there was nothing I more anxiously wished to hear.

      He then gave me the full narration, interesting, curious, extraordinary;
      full of promise and hope. He is extremely pleased both with the doctor and
      his son, Dr. John, he says they are fine, lively, natural, independent
      characters.

    <p>
      Sunday, Dec. 7.&mdash;Very bad Was this morning&rsquo;s account. Lady
      Charlotte Finch read prayers to the queen and princess, and Lady Courtown,
      and the rest for themselves. M r. Fairly wishes her majesty would summon a
      chaplain, and let the house join in congregation. I think he is right, as
      far as the house extends to those who are still admitted into her majesty&rsquo;s
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dec. 8.&mdash;The accounts began mending considerably, and hope broke in
      upon all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dec. 9.&mdash;&mdash;All gets now into a better channel, and the dear
      royal invalid gives every symptom of amendment. God be praised!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dec. 11.&mdash;To-day We have had the fairest hopes: the king took his
      first walk in Kew garden! There have been impediments to this trial
      hitherto, that have been thought insurmountable, though, in fact, they
      were most frivolous. The walk seemed to do him good, and we are all in
      better<span class="pagenum">275</span><a name="link275" id="link275"></a>
      spirits about him than for this many and many a long day past.

    <h2>
      MRS. SCHWELLENBERG&rsquo;S OPINION OF MR. FAIRLY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dec. 12.&mdash;This day passed in much the same manner. Late in the
      evening, after Mr. Smelt was gone, Mrs. Schwellenberg began talking about
      Mr. Fairly, and giving free vent to all her strong innate aversion to him.
      She went back to the old history of the &ldquo;newseepaper,&rdquo; and
      gave to his naming it every unheard motive of spite, disloyalty, and
      calumny! three qualities which I believe equally and utterly unknown to
      him. He was also, she said, &ldquo;very onfeeling, for she had heard him
      laugh prodigious with the Lady Waldegraves, Perticleer with lady Carlisle,
      what you call Lady Elizabeth her sister, and this in the king&rsquo;s
      illness.&rdquo; And, in fine, she could not bear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such gross injustice I could not hear quietly. I began a warm defence,
      protesting I knew no one whose heart was more feelingly devoted to the
      royal family, except, perhaps, Mr. Smelt; and that as to his laughing, it
      must have been at something of passing and accidental amusement, since he
      was grave even to melancholy, except when he exerted his spirits for the
      relief or entertainment of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally amazed and provoked, she disdainfully asked me what I knew of him?
    </p>
    <p>
      I made no answer. I was not quite prepared for the interrogatory, and
      feared she might next inquire when and where I had seen him?
    </p>
    <p>
      My silence was regarded as self-conviction of error, and she added,
      &ldquo;I know you can&rsquo;t not know him; I know he had never seen you
      two year and half ago; when you came here he had not heard your name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two years and a half,&rdquo; I answered coolly, &ldquo;I did not
      regard as a short time for forming a judgment of any one&rsquo;s
      character.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you don&rsquo;t not see them? You have never seen him, I am
      sure, but once, or what you call twice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not dare let this pass, it was so very wide from the truth; but
      calmly said I had seen him much oftener than once or twice. &ldquo;And
      where? when have you seen him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many times; and at Cheltenham constantly; but never to observe in
      him anything but honour and goodness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O ver well! you don&rsquo;t not know him like me, you can&rsquo;t<span
      class="pagenum">276</span><a name="link276" id="link276"></a> not know
      him; he is not from your acquaintance&mdash;I know that ver well!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She presently went on by herself. &ldquo;You could not know such a person&mdash;he
      told me the same himself: he told me he had not never seen you when you
      first came. You might see him at Cheltenham, that is true; but nothing
      others, I am sure. At Windsor there was no tea, not once, so you can&rsquo;t
      not have seen him, only at Cheltenham.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I hardly knew whether to laugh or be frightened at this width of error;
      nor, indeed, whether it was not all some artifice to draw me out, from
      pique, into some recital: at all events I thought it best to say nothing,
      for she was too affronting to deserve to be set right.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on to the same purpose some time, more than insinuating that a
      person such as Mr. Fairly could never let him self down to be acquainted
      with me; till finding me too much offended to think her assertions worth
      answering, she started, at last, another subject. I then forced myself to
      talk much as usual. But how did I rejoice when the clock struck ten&mdash;how
      wish it had been twelve!

    <h2>
      THE KING&rsquo;S VARYING CONDITION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dec. 15.&mdash;This whole day was passed in great internal agitation
      throughout the house, as the great and important business of the Regency
      was to be discussed to-morrow in Parliament. All is now too painful and
      intricate for writing a word. I begin to confine my memorandums almost
      wholly to my own personal proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dec. 16.&mdash;Whatsoever might pass in the House on this momentous
      subject, it sat so late that no news could arrive. Sweeter and better
      news, however, was immediately at hand than any the whole senate could
      transmit; the account from the pages was truly cheering. With what joy did
      I hasten with it to the queen, who immediately ordered me to be its
      welcome messenger to the three princesses. And when Mr. Smelt came to my
      breakfast, with what rapture did he receive it! seizing and kissing my
      hand, while his eyes ran over, and joy seemed quite to bewitch him. He
      flew away in a very few minutes, to share his happiness with his faithful
      partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast I had a long conference in the parlour with Sir Lucas
      Pepys, who justly gloried in the advancement of his original prediction;
      but there had been much dissension <span class="pagenum">277</span><a
      name="link277" id="link277"></a> amongst the physicians, concerning the
      bulletin to go to St. James&rsquo;s, no two agreeing in the degree of
      better to be announced to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Willis came in while we were conversing, but instantly retreated, to
      leave us undisturbed. He looks a very fine old man. I wish to be
      introduced to him. Mr. Smelt and Mr. Fairly are both quite enchanted with
      all the family; for another son now, a clergyman, Mr. Thomas Willis, has
      joined their forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dec. 17.&mdash;MY account this morning was most afflictive once more: it
      was given by Mr. Hawkins, and was cruelly subversive of all our rising
      hopes. I carried it to the queen in trembling but she bore it most mildly.
      What resignation is hers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dec. 22.&mdash;With what joy did I carry, this morning, an exceeding good
      account of the king to my royal mistress! It was trebly welcome., as much
      might depend upon it in the resolutions of the House concerning the
      Regency, which was of to-day&rsquo;s discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairly took leave, for a week, he said, wishing me my health, while I
      expressed my own wishes for his good journey But, in looking forward to a
      friendship the most permanent, saw the eligibility of rendering it the
      most open. I therefore went back to Mrs. Schwellenberg; and the moment I
      received a reproach for staying so long, I calmly answered, &ldquo;Mr.
      Fairly had made me a visit, to take leave before he went into the country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazement was perhaps never more indignant. Mr. Fairly to take leave of
      me! while not once he even called upon her! This offence swallowed up all
      other comments upon the communication. I seemed not to understand it; but
      we had a terrible two hours and a-half. Yet to such, now, I may look
      forward without any mixture, any alleviation, for evening after evening in
      this sad abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      N.B. My own separate adventures for this month, and year, concluded upon
      this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king went on now better, now worse, in a most fearful manner; but Sir
      Lucas Pepys never lost sight of hope, and the management of Dr. Willis and
      his two sons was most wonderfully acute and successful. Yet so much were
      they perplexed and tormented by the interruptions given to their plans and
      methods, that they were frequently almost tempted to resign the
      undertaking from anger and confusion.<span class="pagenum">278</span><a
      name="link278" id="link278"></a> DR. WILLIS AND His SON.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kew Palace, Thursday, Jan. 1, 1789.&mdash;The year opened with an account
      the most promising of our beloved king. I saw Dr. Willis, and he told me
      the night had been very tranquil and he sent for his son, Dr. John Willis,
      to give me a history of the morning. Dr. John&rsquo;s narration was in
      many parts very affecting: the dear and excellent king had been praying
      for his own restoration! Both the doctors told me that such strong
      symptoms of true piety had scarce ever been discernible through so
      dreadful a malady.
    </p>
    <p>
      How I hastened to my queen!&mdash;and with what alacrity I besought
      permission to run next to the princesses! It was so sweet, so soothing, to
      open a new year with the solace of anticipated good!
    </p>
    <p>
      Jan. 3.&mdash;I have the great pleasure, now, of a change in my morning&rsquo;s
      historiographers; I have made acquaintance with Dr. Willis and his son,
      and they have desired me to summon one of them constantly for my
      information. I am extremely struck with both these physicians. Dr. Willis
      is a man of ten thousand; open, holiest, dauntless, lighthearted,
      innocent, and high minded: I see him impressed with the most animated
      reverence and affection for his royal patient; but it is wholly for his
      character,&mdash;not a whit for his rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. John, his eldest son, is extremely handsome, and inherits, in a milder
      degree, all the qualities of his father; but living more in the general
      world, and having his fame and fortune still to settle, he has not yet
      acquired the same courage, nor is he, by nature, quite so sanguine in his
      opinions. The manners of both are extremely pleasing, and they both
      proceed completely their own way, not merely unacquainted with court
      etiquette, but wholly, and most artlessly, unambitious to form any such
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jan. 11.&mdash;This morning Dr. John gave me but a bad account of the poor
      king. His amendment is not progressive; it fails, and goes back, and
      disappoints most grievously; yet it would be nothing were the case and its
      circumstances less discussed, and were expectation more reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jan. 12.&mdash;A melancholy day: news bad both at home and abroad. At home
      the dear unhappy king still worse&mdash;abroad new examinations voted of
      the physicians! Good heaven! what an insult does this seem from
      parliamentary power, to investigate and bring forth to the world every
      circumstance Of<span class="pagenum">279</span><a name="link279"
      id="link279"></a> such a malady as is ever held sacred to secrecy in the
      most private families! How indignant we all feel here no words can say.

    <h2>
      LEARNING IN WOMEN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jan. 13.&mdash;The two younger Willises, Dr. John and Mr. Thomas, came
      upstairs in the afternoon, to make a visit to Mrs. Schwellenberg. I took
      the opportunity to decamp to my own room, where I found Mr. Fairly in
      waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of conversation that followed, Mrs. Carter was named: Mr.
      Smelt is seriously of opinion her ode is the best in our language.<a
      href="#linknote-301" name="linknoteref-301" id="linknoteref-301"><small>301</small></a>
      I spoke of her very highly, for indeed I reverence her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning in women was then Our theme. I rather wished to hear than to
      declaim upon this subject, yet I never seek to disguise that I think it
      has no recommendation of sufficient value to compensate its evil
      excitement of envy and satire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with very uncommon liberality on the female powers and
      intellects, and protested he had never, in his commerce with the world,
      been able to discern any other inferiority in their parts than what
      resulted from their Pursuits-and yet, with all this, he doubted much
      whether he had ever seen any woman who might not have been rather better
      without than with the learned languages, one only excepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was some time silent, and I could not but suppose he meant his
      correspondent, Miss Fuzilier; but, with a very tender sigh, he said,
      &ldquo;And she was my mother,&mdash;who neglected nothing else, while she
      cultivated Latin, and who knew it very well, and would have known it very
      superiorly, but that her brother disliked her studying, and one day burnt
      all her books!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This anecdote led to one in return, from myself. I told him, briefly the
      history of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s most kind condescension, in desiring to
      make me his pupil, and beginning to give me regular lessons of the Latin
      language, and i proceeded to the speedy conclusion&mdash;my great
      apprehension,&mdash;conviction rather,&mdash;that what I learnt of so
      great a man could never be private, and that he himself would contemn
      concealment, if any<span class="pagenum">280</span><a name="link280"
      id="link280"></a> progress should be made; which to Me was sufficient
      motive for relinquishing the scheme, and declining the honour, highly as I
      valued it, of obtaining Such a master&mdash;&ldquo;and this,&rdquo; I
      added, &ldquo;though difficult to be done without offending, was yet the
      better effected, as my father himself likes and approves all
      accomplishments for women better than the dead languages.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE QUEEN AND MR. FAIRLY&rsquo;S VISITS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jan. 14.&mdash;I must now mention a rather singular conversation. I had no
      opportunity last night to name, as usual, my visitor; but I have done it
      so often, so constantly indeed, that I was not uneasy In the omission.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this morning, while her hair was dressing, my royal Mistress suddenly
      said, &ldquo;Did you see any body yesterday?&rdquo; I could not but be
      sure of her meaning, and though vexed to be anticipated in my avowal,
      which had but waited the departure of the wardrobe-woman, Sandys, I
      instantly answered, &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am; Mr. Smelt in the morning and
      Mr. Fairly in the evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! Mr. Fairly was here, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was now doubly sorry she should know this only from me! He had Mentioned
      being just come from town, but I had concluded Lady Charlotte Finch, as
      usual, knew of his arrival, and had made it known to her Majesty. A little
      while after,&mdash;&ldquo;Did he go away from you early?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I Immediately answered, &ldquo;not early:
      he drank tea with Me, as he generally does, I believe, when he is here for
      the night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; cried she after a pause, &ldquo;the gentlemen below
      do not drink tea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell, ma&rsquo;am, I never heard him say; I only know he
      asked me if I would give him some, and I told him yes, with great
      pleasure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Never did I feel so happy in unblushing consciousness of internal liberty
      as in this little catechism! However, I soon found I had Mistaken the
      Motive of the catechism: it was not on account of Mr. Fairly and his
      visit; it was all for Mrs. Schwellenberg and her no visits; for she soon
      dropped something of &ldquo;poor Mrs. Schwellenberg&rdquo; and her
      Miserable state, that opened her whole meaning.<span class="pagenum">281</span><a

      Sunday, Jan. 18.&mdash;The public birthday of my poor royal mistress. How
      sadly did she pass it; and how was I filled With sorrow for her
      reflections upon this its first anniversary for these last twenty-eight
      years in which the king and the nation have not united in its celebration!
      All now was passed over in silence and obscurity; all observance of the

    <h2>
      MR. FAIRLY ON FANS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jan. 21.&mdash;I came to my room; and there, in my own corner, sat poor
      Mr. Fairly, looking a little forlorn, and telling me he had been there
      near an hour. I made every apology that could mark in the strongest manner
      how little I thought his patience worth such exertion....
    </p>
    <p>
      He was going to spend the next day at St. Leonard&rsquo;s, where he was to
      meet his son; and he portrayed to me the character of Mrs. Harcourt so
      fairly and favourably, that her flightiness sunk away on the rise of her
      good qualities. He spoke of his chapel of St. Catherine&rsquo;s, its
      emoluments, chaplain, brothers, sisters, and full establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding I entered into nothing, he took up a fan which lay on my table,
      and began playing off various imitative airs with it, exclaiming, &ldquo;How
      thoroughly useless a toy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;on the contrary, taken as an ornament, it
      was the most useful ornament of any belonging to full dress, occupying the
      hands, giving the eyes something to look at, and taking away stiffness and
      formality from the figure and deportment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men have no fans,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;and how do they do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse,&rdquo; quoth I, plumply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed quite out, saying, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s ingenuous, however; and,
      indeed, I must confess they are reduced, from time to time, to shift their
      hands from one pocket to another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not, to speak of lounging about in their chairs from one side to
      another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the real use of a fan,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;if there is any,
      is it not&mdash;to hide a particular blush that ought not to appear?"<span
      class="pagenum">282</span><a name="link282" id="link282"></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no; it would rather make it the sooner noticed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; it may be done under pretence of absence&mdash;rubbing
      the cheek, or nose&mdash;putting it up accidentally to the eye&mdash;in a
      thousand ways.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He went through all these evolutions comically enough, and then, putting
      aside his toy, came back to graver matters.

    <h2>
      MR. FAIRLY CONTINUES HIS VISITS: THE QUEEN AGAIN REMARKS UPON THEM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jan. 26.&mdash;In the evening Mr. Fairly came to tea. He was grave, and my
      reception did not make him gayer. General discourse took place till Mrs.
      Dickenson happened to be named. He knew her very well as Miss Hamilton.
      Her conjugal conduct, in displaying her Superior power over her husband,
      was our particular theme, till in the midst of it he exclaimed, &ldquo;How
      well you will be trained in by Mrs. Schwellenberg&mdash;if you come to
      trial!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! thought I, the more I suffer through her, the less and less do I feel
      disposed to run any new and more lasting risk, But I said not this. I only
      protested I was much less her humble servant than might be supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can that be,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;when you never contest any
      one point with her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not, I said, in positive wrangling, which could never answer its horrible
      pain; but still I refused undue obedience when exacted with indignity, and
      always hastened to retire when offended and affronted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Emmeline,"<a href="#linknote-302"
      name="linknoteref-302" id="linknoteref-302"><small>302</small></a> which
      is just lent me by the queen; but he found it not piquant and putting it
      down, begged me to choose him a Rambler. I had a good deal of difficulty
      in my decision, as he had already seen almost all I could particularly
      wish to recommend; and, when he saw me turn over leaf after leaf with some
      hesitation, he began a serious reproach to me of inflexible reserve. And
      then away he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hastened immediately to Mrs. Schwellenberg; and found all in a tumult.
      She had been, she said, alone all the evening, and was going to have sent
      for me, but found I had my company. She sent for Mlle. Montmoulin but she
      had a cold; for Miss Gomme, but she could not come because of the snow;<span
      class="pagenum">283</span><a name="link283" id="link283"></a> for Miss
      Planta but she was ill with a fever, &ldquo;what you call head-ache:&rdquo;
      she had then &ldquo;sent to princess royal, who had been to her, and
      pitied her ver moch, for princess royal was really sensible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And all this was communicated with a look of accusation, and a tone of
      menace, that might have suited an attack upon some hardened felon....
    </p>
    <p>
      I made no sort of apology nor any other answer than that I had had the
      honour of Mr. Fairly&rsquo;s company to tea, which was always a pleasure
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe something like consciousness whispered her here, that it might
      really be possible his society was as pleasant as I had found hers, for
      she then dropped her lamentation, and said she thanked God she wanted
      nobody, not one; she could always amuse herself, and was glad enough to be
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were it but true!
    </p>
    <p>
      I offered cards: she refused, because it was too late, though we yet
      remained together near two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this a little disordered me, You will not think what followed was
      matter of composure. While the queen&rsquo;s hair was rolling up, by the
      wardrobe woman, at night, Mrs. Schwellenberg happened to leave the room,
      and almost instantly her majesty, in a rather abrupt manner, said &ldquo;Is
      Mr. Fairly here to-night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did he come back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not recollect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know he was here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This thunderstruck me; that he should come again, or stay, at least,
      without apprising his royal mistress, startled me inwardly, and distressed
      me outwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew, indeed,&rdquo; she then added, &ldquo;he was here in the
      morning, but I understood he went away afterwards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of connivance now struck me with a real disdain, that brought
      back my courage and recollection in full force, and I answered, &ldquo;I
      remember, ma&rsquo;am, he told me he had rode over to Richmond park at
      noon, and returned here to dinner with Colonel Wellbred, and in the
      evening he drank tea with me, and said he should sup with General
      Harcourt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, spoken with an openness that rather invited than shunned further
      investigation, seemed to give an immediate satisfaction; the tone of voice
      changed to its usual <span class="pagenum">284</span><a name="link284"
      id="link284"></a>complacency, and she inquired various things concerning
      the Stuart family, and then spoke upon more common topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      I concluded it now all over; but soon after Mrs. Sandys went away, and
      then, very unexpectedly, the queen renewed the subject. &ldquo;The reason,&rdquo;
      she said, &ldquo;that I asked about Mr. Fairly was that the Schwellenberg
      sent to ask Miss Planta to come to her, because Mr. Fairly was&mdash;no,
      not with her&mdash;he never goes to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped; but I was wholly silent. I felt instantly with how little
      propriety I could undertake either to defend or to excuse Mr. Fairly, whom
      I determined to consider as a visitor, over whom, having no particular
      influence, I could be charged with no particular responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      After waiting a few minutes, &ldquo;With you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Mr.
      Fairly was and the Schwellenberg was alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      My spirits quite panted at this moment to make a full confession of the
      usage I had endured from the person thus compassionated; but I had so
      frequently resolved, in moments of cool deliberation, not even to risk
      doing mischief to a favourite old servant, that I withstood the impulse;
      but the inward conflict silenced me from saying anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe she was surprised but she added, after a long pause, &ldquo;I
      believe&mdash;he comes to you every evening when here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, ma&rsquo;am, always, when he is here or away; but I
      am always very glad to see him, for indeed his visits make all the little
      variety that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I hastily stopped, lest she should think me discontented with this strict
      confinement during this dreadful season; and that I can never be, when it
      is not accompanied by tyranny and injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She immediately took up the word, but without the slightest displeasure.
      &ldquo;Why here there might be more variety than anywhere, from the
      nearness to town, except for&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The present situation of things.&rdquo; I eagerly interrupted her
      to say, and went on: &ldquo;Indeed, ma&rsquo;am, I have scarce a wish to
      break into the present arrangement, by seeing anybody while the house is
      in this state; nor have I, from last October, seen one human being that
      does not live here, except Mr. Smelt, Mr. Fairly, and Sir Lucas Pepys; and
      they all come upon their own calls, and not for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only objection,&rdquo; she gently answered, &ldquo;to seeing
      anybody, is that every one who comes carries some sort of information away
      with them."<span class="pagenum">285</span><a name="link285" id="link285"></a>
      I assured her I was perfectly content to wait for better times, Here the
      matter dropped; she appeared satisfied with what I said, and became soft
      and serene as before the little attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jan. 27.&mdash;The intelligence this morning was not very pleasant. I had
      a conference afterwards with Sir Lucas Pepys, who keeps up undiminished
      hope. We held our council in the physicians&rsquo; room, which chanced to
      be empty; but before it broke up Colonel Wellbred entered. It was a
      pleasure to me to see him, though somewhat an embarrassment to hear him
      immediately lament that we never met, and add that he knew not in what
      manner to procure himself that pleasure. I joined in the lamentation, and
      its cause, which confined us all to our cells. Sir Lucas declared my
      confinement menaced my health, and charged me to walk out, and take air
      and exercise very sedulously, if I would avoid an illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Wellbred instantly offered me a key of Richmond gardens, which
      opened into them by a nearer door than what was used in common. I accepted
      his kindness, and took an hour&rsquo;s walk,-for the first time since last
      October; ten minutes in Kew gardens are all I have spent without doors
      since the middle of that month.

    <h2>
      THE SEARCH FOR MR. FAIRLY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jan. 30.&mdash;To-day my poor royal mistress received the address of the
      Lords and Commons, of condolence, etc., upon his majesty&rsquo;s illness.
      What a painful, but necessary ceremony! It was most properly presented by
      but few members, and those almost all chosen from the household: a great
      propriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after came Mr. Fairly, looking harassed. &ldquo;May I,&rdquo; he
      cried, &ldquo;come in?&mdash;and-for an hour? Can you allow me entrance
      and room for that time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Much Surprised, for already it was three o&rsquo;clock, I assented: he
      then told me he had something to copy for her majesty, which was of the
      highest importance, and said he could find no quiet room in the house but
      mine for such a business. I gave him every accommodation in my power. When
      he had written a few lines, he asked if I was very busy, or could help
      him? Most readily I offered my services, and then I read to him the
      original, sentence by sentence, to facilitate his copying; receiving his
      assurances of my &ldquo;great assistance&rdquo; every two lines. In the
      midst of this occupation,<span class="pagenum">286</span><a name="link286"
      id="link286"></a> a tap at my door made me precipitately put down the
      paper to receive-lady Charlotte Finch!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;have the goodness to tell me any
      thing of Mr. Fairly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The screen had hidden him; but, gently,&mdash;though, I believe ill enough
      pleased,&mdash;he called out himself, &ldquo;Here is Mr. Fairly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She flew up to him, crying, &ldquo;O, Mr. Fairly, what a search has there
      been for you, by the queen&rsquo;s orders! She has wanted you extremely,
      and no one knew where to find you. They have been to the waiting-room, to
      the equerries&rsquo;, all over the garden, to the prince&rsquo;s house, in
      your own room, and could find you nowhere, and at last they thought you
      were gone back to town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He calmly answered, while he still wrote on, he was sorry they had had so
      much trouble, for he had only been executing her majesty&rsquo;s commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then hesitated a little, almost to stammering, in adding &ldquo;So&mdash;at
      last&mdash;I said&mdash;that perhaps&mdash;you might be here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He now raised his head from the paper, and bowing it towards me, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
      he cried, &ldquo;Miss Burney is so good as to give me leave, and there is
      no other room in the house in Which I can be at rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I told her majesty,&rdquo; answered Lady Charlotte, &ldquo;though
      she said she was sure you could not be here; but I said there was really
      no room of quiet here for any business, and so then I came to see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Burney,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;has the goodness also to
      help me&mdash;she has taken the trouble to read as I go on, which forwards
      me very much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Charlotte stared, and I felt sorry at this confession of a confidence
      she could not but think too much, and I believe he half repented it, for
      he added, &ldquo;This, however, you need not perhaps mention, though I
      know where I trust!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded again with his writing, and she then recollected her errand.
      She told him that what he was copying was to be carried to town by Lord
      Aylesbury, but the queen desired to see it first. She then returned to her
      majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She soon, however, returned again. She brought the queen&rsquo;s seal, and
      leave that he might make up the packet, and give it to Lord Aylesbury,
      without showing it first to her majesty, who was just gone to dinner. With
      her customary good-humour<span class="pagenum">287</span><a name="link287"
      id="link287"></a> and good-breeding, she then chatted with me some time,
      and again departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then went to work with all our might, reading and copying. The original
      was extremely curious&mdash;I am sorry I must make it equally secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss BURNEY&rsquo;s ALARM ON BEING CHASED BY THE KING. Kew Palace, Monday,
      Feb. 2.&mdash;What an adventure had I this morning! one that has
      occasioned me the severest personal terror I ever experienced in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Lucas Pepys still persisting that exercise and air were absolutely
      necessary to save me from illness, I have continued my walks, varying my
      gardens from Richmond to Kew, according to the accounts I received of the
      movements of the king. For this I had her majesty&rsquo;s permission, on
      the representation of Sir Lucas. This morning, when I received my
      intelligence of the king from Dr. John Willis, I begged to know where I
      might walk in safety? &ldquo;In Kew gardens,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as the
      king would be in Richmond.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should any unfortunate circumstance,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;at any
      time, occasion my being seen by his majesty, do not mention my name, but
      let me run off without call or notice.&rdquo; This he promised. Everybody,
      indeed, is ordered to keep out of sight. Taking, therefore, the time I had
      most at command, I strolled into the gardens. I had proceeded, in my quick
      way, nearly half the round, when I suddenly perceived, through some trees,
      two or three figures. Relying on the instructions of Dr. John, I concluded
      them to be workmen and gardeners; yet tried to look sharp, and in so
      doing, as they were less shaded, I thought I saw the person of his
      majesty!
    </p>
    <p>
      Alarmed past all possible expression, I waited not to know more, but
      turning back, ran off with all my might. But what was my terror to hear
      myself pursued!&mdash;to hear the voice of the king himself loudly and
      hoarsely calling after me, &ldquo;<i>Miss</i> Burney! Miss Burney!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I protest I was ready to die. I knew not in what state he might be at the
      time; I only knew the orders to keep out of his way were universal; that
      the queen would highly disapprove any unauthorized meeting, and that the
      very action of my running away might deeply, in his present irritable
      state, offend him. Nevertheless, on I ran, too terrified to stop, and
      <span class="pagenum">288</span><a name="link288" id="link288"></a> In
      search Of some short passage, for the garden is full of labyrinths, by
      which I might escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steps still pursued me, and Still the poor hoarse and altered voice
      rang in my ears:&mdash;more and more footsteps sounded frightfully behind
      me,&mdash;the attendants all running to catch their eager master, and the
      voices of the two Doctor Willises loudly exhorting him not to heat himself
      so unmercifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavens, how I ran! I do not think I should have felt the hot lava from
      Vesuvius&mdash;at least not the hot cinders&mdash;had I so run during its
      eruption. My feet were not sensible that they even touched the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after, I heard other voices, shriller, though less nervous, call out
      &ldquo;Stop! stop! stop!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I could by no means consent: I knew not what was purposed, but I
      recollected fully my agreement with Dr. John that very morning, that I
      should decamp if Surprised, and not b named. My own fears and repugnance,
      also, after a flight and disobedience like this, were doubled in the
      thought of not escaping; I knew not to what I might be exposed, should the
      malady be then high, and take the turn of resentment. Still, therefore, on
      I flew; and such was my speed, so almost incredible to relate or
      recollect, that I fairly believe no one of the whole party could have
      overtaken me, if these words, from one of the attendants, had not reached
      me, &ldquo;Doctor Willis begs you to stop!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot! I cannot!&rdquo; I answered, still flying on, when he
      called out, &ldquo;You must, ma&rsquo;am; it hurts the king to run.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, indeed, I stopped&mdash;in a state of fear really amounting to
      agony. I turned round, I saw the two doctors had got the king between
      them, and three attendants of Dr. Willis&rsquo;s were hovering about. They
      all slackened their pace, as they saw me stand still; but such was the
      excess of my alarm, that I was wholly insensible to the effects of a race
      which, at any other time, would have required an hour&rsquo;s recruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they approached, some little presence of mind happily came to my
      command it occurred to me that, to appease the wrath of my flight, I must
      now show some confidence: I therefore faced them as undauntedly as I was
      able, only charging the nearest of the attendants to stand by my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were within a few yards of me, the king called out, &ldquo;Why
      did you run away?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shocked at a question impossible to answer, yet a little<span
      class="pagenum">289</span><a name="link289" id="link289"></a> assured by
      the mild tone of his voice, I instantly forced myself forward, to meet
      him, though the internal sensation which satisfied me this was a step the
      most proper, to appease his suspicions and displeasure, was so violently
      combated by the tremor of my nerves, that I fairly think I may reckon it
      the greatest effort of personal courage-I have ever made.

    <h2>
      A ROYAL SALUTE AND ROYAL CONFIDENCES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The effort answered: I looked up, and met all his wonted benignity of
      countenance, though something still of wildness in his eyes. Think,
      however, of my surprise, to feel him put both his hands round my two
      shoulders, and then kiss my cheek! I wonder I did not really sink, so
      exquisite was my affright when I saw him spread out his arms!
      Involuntarily, I concluded he meant to crush me: but the Willises, who
      have never seen him till this fatal illness, not knowing how very
      extraordinary an action this was from him, simply smiled and looked
      pleased, supposing, perhaps, it was his customary salutation!
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe, however, it was but the joy of a heart unbridled, now, by the
      forms and proprieties of established custom and sober reason. To see any
      of his household thus by accident, seemed such a near approach to liberty
      and recovery, that who can wonder it should serve rather to elate than
      lessen what yet remains of his disorder!
    </p>
    <p>
      He now spoke in such terms of his pleasure in seeing me, that I soon lost
      the whole of my terror; astonishment to find him so nearly well, and
      gratification to see him so pleased, removed every uneasy feeling, and the
      joy that succeeded, in my conviction of his recovery, made me ready to
      throw myself at his feet to express it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What conversation followed! When he saw me fearless, he grew more and more
      alive, and made me walk close by his side, away from the attendants, and
      even the Willises themselves, who, to indulge him, retreated. I own myself
      not completely composed, but alarm I could entertain no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything that came uppermost in his mind he mentioned; he seemed to have
      just such remains of his flightiness as heated his imagination without
      deranging his reason, and robbed him of all control over his speech,
      though nearly in his perfect state Of mind as to his opinions. What did he
      not say!&mdash;He opened<span class="pagenum">290</span><a name="link290"
      id="link290"></a> his whole heart to me,&mdash;expounded all his
      sentiments, and acquainted me with all his intentions.

    <p>
      The heads of his discourse I must give you briefly, as I am sure you will
      be highly curious to hear them, and as no accident can render of much
      consequence what a man says in such a state of physical intoxication. He
      assured me he was quite well&mdash;as well as he had ever been in his
      life; and then inquired how I did, and how I went on? and whether I was
      more comfortable? If these questions, in their implications, surprised me,
      imagine how that surprise must increase when he proceeded to explain them!
      He asked after the coadjutrix, laughing, and saying &ldquo;Never mind her!&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      be oppressed&mdash;I am your friend! don&rsquo;t let her cast you down!&mdash;I
      know you have a hard time of it&mdash;but don&rsquo;t mind her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost thunderstruck with astonishment, I merely curtsied to his kind
      &ldquo;I am your friend,&rdquo; and said nothing. Then presently he added,
      &ldquo;Stick to your father&mdash;stick to your own family&mdash;let them
      be your objects.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How readily I assented! Again he repeated all I have just written, nearly
      in the same words, but ended it more seriously: He suddenly stopped, and
      held me to stop too, and putting his hand on his breast. in the most
      solemn manner, he gravely and slowly said, &ldquo;I will protect you!&mdash;I
      promise you that&mdash;and therefore depend upon me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him; and the Willises, thinking him rather too elevated, came to
      propose my walking on. &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; he cried, a hundred times
      in a breath and their good humour prevailed, and they let him again walk
      on with his new Companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then gave me a history of his pages, animating almost into a rage, as
      he related his subjects of displeasure with them, particularly with Mr.
      Ernst, who he told me had been brought up by himself. I hope his ideas
      upon these men are the result of the mistakes of his malady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he asked me some questions that very greatly &amp;stressed me,
      relating to information given him in his illness, from various motives,
      but which he suspected to be false, and which I knew he had reason to
      suspect: yet was It most dangerous to set anything right, as I was not
      aware what might be the views of their having been stated wrong. I was as
      discreet as I knew how to be, and I hope I did no mischief; but this was
      the worst part of the dialogue.<span class="pagenum">291</span><a
      name="link291" id="link291"></a> He next talked to me a great deal of my
      dear father, and made a thousand inquiries concerning his &ldquo;History
      of Music.&rdquo; This brought him to his favourite theme, Handel; and he
      told me innumerable anecdotes of him, and particularly that celebrated
      tale of Handel&rsquo;s saying of himself, when a boy, &ldquo;While that
      boy lives, my music will never want a protector.&rdquo; And this, he said,
      I might relate to my father. Then he ran over most of his oratorios,
      attempting to sing the subjects of several airs and choruses, but so
      dreadfully hoarse that the sound was terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Willis, quite alarmed at this exertion, feared he would do himself
      harm, and again proposed a separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no! no!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;not yet; I have something I
      must just mention first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Willis, delighted to comply, even when uneasy at compliance, again
      gave way. The good king then greatly affected me. He began upon my revered
      old friend, Mrs. Delany and he spoke of her with such warmth&mdash;such
      kindness! &ldquo;She was my friend!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and I loved
      her as a friend! I have made a memorandum when I lost her&mdash;I will
      show it YOU.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled out a pocket-book, and rummaged some time, but to no purpose.
      The tears stood in his eyes&mdash;he wiped them, and Dr. Willis again
      became very anxious. &ldquo;Come, sir,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;now do you
      come in and let the lady go on her walk, come, now you have talked a long
      while, so we&rsquo;ll go in,&mdash;if your majesty pleases.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I want to ask her a few questions&mdash;I
      have lived so long out of the world, I know nothing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This touched me to the heart. We walked on together, and he inquired after
      various persons, particularly Mrs. Boscawen, because she was Mrs. Delany&rsquo;s
      friend! Then, for the same reason, after Mr. Frederick Montagu,<a
      href="#linknote-303" name="linknoteref-303" id="linknoteref-303"><small>303</small></a>
      of whom he kindly said, &ldquo;I know he has a great regard for me, for
      all he joined the opposition.&rdquo; Lord Grey de Wilton, Sir Watkin Wynn,
      the Duke of Beaufort, and various others, followed. He then told me he was
      very much dissatisfied with several of his state officers, and meant to
      form an entire new establishment. He took a paper out of his pocket-book,
      and showed me his new list.<span class="pagenum">292</span><a
      name="link292" id="link292"></a> This was the wildest thing that passed;
      and Dr. John Willis now seriously urged our separating; but he would not
      consent he had only three more words to say, he declared, and again he
      conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now spoke of my father, with still more kindness, and told me he ought
      to have had the post of master of the band, and not that little poor
      musician Parsons, who was not fit for it: &ldquo;But Lord Salisbury,&rdquo;
      he cried, &ldquo;used your father very ill in that business, and so he did
      me! However, I have dashed out his name, and I shall put your father&rsquo;s
      in,&mdash;as soon as I get loose again!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This again&mdash;how affecting was this!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;has your father got, at last?
      nothing but that poor thing at Chelsea?<a href="#linknote-304"
      name="linknoteref-304" id="linknoteref-304"><small>304</small></a> O fie!
      fie! fie! But never mind! I will take care of him. I will do it myself!&rdquo;
      Then presently he added, &ldquo;As to Lord Salisbury, he is out already,
      as this memorandum will show you, and so are many more. I shall be much
      better served and when once I get away, I shall rule with a rod of iron!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was very unlike himself, and startled the two good doctors, who could
      not bear to cross him, and were exulting at seeing his great amendment,
      but yet grew quite uneasy at his earnestness and volubility. Finding we
      now must part, he stopped to take leave, and renewed again his charges
      about the coadjutrix. &ldquo;Never mind her!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;depend
      upon me! I will be your friend as long as I live&mdash;I here pledge
      myself to be your friend!&rdquo; And then he saluted me again just as at
      the meeting, and suffered me to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a scene! how variously was I affected by it! but, upon the whole, how
      inexpressibly thankful to see him so nearly himself&mdash;so little
      removed from recovery!

    <h2>
      CURIOSITY REGARDING Miss BURNEY&rsquo;S MEETING WITH THE KING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I went very soon after to the queen to whom I was most eager to avow the
      meeting, and how little I could help it. Her astonishment, and her
      earnestness to hear every particular, were very great. I told her almost
      all. Some few things relating to the distressing questions I could not
      repeat nor <span class="pagenum">293</span><a name="link293" id="link293"></a>
      many things said of Mrs. Schwellenberg, which would much, very needlessly,
      have hurt her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This interview, and the circumstances belonging to it, excited general
      curiosity, and all the house watched for opportunities to beg a relation
      of it. How delighted was I to tell them all my happy prognostics!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the first to hasten to hear of it was Mr. Smelt; eager and enchanted
      was the countenance and attention of that truly loyal and most
      affectionate adherent to his old master. He wished me to see Lady Harcourt
      and the general, and to make them a brief relation of this extraordinary
      rencounter but for that I had not effort enough left.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did what I Could, however, to gratify the curiosity of Colonel Wellbred,
      which I never saw equally excited. I was passing him on the stairs, and he
      followed me, to say he had heard what had happened&mdash;I imagine from
      the Willises. I told him, with the highest satisfaction, the general
      effect produced upon my mind by the accident, that the king seemed so
      nearly, himself, that patience itself could have but little longer trial.
      He wanted to hear more particulars: I fancy the Willises had vaguely
      related some: &ldquo;Did he not,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;promise to do
      something for you?&rdquo; I only laughed, and answered, &ldquo;O yes! if
      you want any thing, apply to me;&mdash;now is my time!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Feb. 3.&mdash;-I had the great happiness to be assured this morning, by
      both the Dr. Willises, that his majesty was by no means the worse for our
      long conference. Those good men are inexpressibly happy themselves in the
      delightful conviction given me, and by me spread about, of the near
      recovery of their royal patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was dressing came Mr. Fairly: I could not admit him, but he said
      he would try again in the evening. I heard by the tone of his voice a
      peculiar eagerness, and doubted not he was apprized of my adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came early, before I could leave my fair companion, and sent on Goter.
      I found him reading a new pamphlet of Horne Tooke: &ldquo;How long,&rdquo;
      he cried, &ldquo;it is since I have been here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not flippantly disposed, or I would have said I had thought the time
      he spent away always short, by his avowed eagerness to decamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made so many inquiries of how I had gone on and what I had done since I
      saw him, that I was soon satisfied he was<span class="pagenum">294</span><a
      name="link294" id="link294"></a> not uninformed of yesterday&rsquo;s
      transaction. I told him so; he could not deny it, but wished to hear the
      whole from myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I most readily complied. He listened with the most eager, nay, anxious
      attention, scarce breathing: he repeatedly exclaimed, when I had finished,
      &ldquo;How I wish I had been there! how I should have liked to have seen
      you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I assured him he would not wish that, if he knew the terror I had
      suffered. He was quite elated with the charges against Cerberic tyranny,
      and expressed himself gratified by the promises of favour and protection.

    <h2>
      THE REGENCY BILL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Feb. 6.&mdash;These last three days have been spent very unpleasantly
      indeed: all goes hardly and difficultly with my poor royal mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet his majesty is now, thank heaven, so much better, that he generally
      sees his gentlemen in some part of the evening; and Mr. Fairly, having no
      particular taste for being kept in waiting whole hours for this
      satisfaction of a few minutes, yet finding himself, if in the house,
      indispensably required to attend with the rest, has changed his Kew visits
      from nights to mornings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought me the &ldquo;Regency Bill!&rdquo;&mdash;I shuddered to hear it
      named. It was just printed, and he read it to me, with comments and
      explanations, which took up all our time, and in a manner, at present, the
      most deeply interesting in which it could be occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tis indeed a dread event!&mdash;and how it may terminate who can say? My
      poor royal mistress is much disturbed. Her daughters behave like angels
      they seem content to reside in this gloomy solitude for ever, if it prove
      of comfort to their mother, or mark their duteous affection for their
      father.

      INFINITELY LICENTIOUS!

    <p>
      Feb. 9.&mdash;I now walk on the road-side, along the park-wall, every fair
      morning, as I shall venture no more into either of the gardens. In
      returning this morning, I was overtaken by Mr. Fairly, who rode up to me,
      and, dismounting, gave his horse to his groom, to walk on with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      About two hours after I was, however, surprised by a visit from him in my
      own room, He came, he said, only to ask<span class="pagenum">295</span><a
      name="link295" id="link295"></a> me a second time how I did, as he should
      be here now less and less, the king&rsquo;s amendment rendering his
      services of smaller and smaller importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought me a new political parody of Pope&rsquo;s &ldquo;Eloisa to
      Abelard,&rdquo; from Mr. Eden to Lord Hawkesbury. It is a most daring,
      though very clever imitation. It introduces many of the present household.
      Mrs. Schwellenberg is now in eternal abuse from all these scribblers; Lady
      Harcourt, and many others, less notorious to their attacks, are here
      brought forward. How infinitely licentious!

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY IS TAXED WITH VISITING GENTLEMEN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Feb. 10.&mdash;The amendment of the king is progressive, and without any
      reasonable fear, though not without some few drawbacks. The Willis family
      were surely sent by heaven to restore peace, and health, and prosperity to
      this miserable house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Charlotte Finch called upon me two days ago, almost purposely, to
      inquire concerning the report of my young friend&rsquo;s marriage; and she
      made me promise to acquaint her when I received any further news: at noon,
      therefore, I went to her apartment at the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s, with
      this information. Mr. Fairly, I knew, was with the equerries in our lodge.
      Lady Charlotte had the Duchess of Beaufort and all the Fieldings with her,
      and therefore I only left a message, by no means, feeling spirits for
      encountering any stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon, when I attended her majesty, she inquired if I had walked?&mdash;Yes.&mdash;Where?&mdash;In
      Richmond gardens.&mdash;And nowhere else?&mdash;No. She looked thoughtful,&mdash;and
      presently I recollected my intended visit to Lady Charlotte, and mentioned
      it. She cleared up, and said, &ldquo;O!&mdash;you. went to Lady Charlotte?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I answered, thinking her very absent,&mdash;which
      I thought with sorrow, as that is so small a part of her character, that I
      know not I ever saw any symptom of it before. Nor, in fact, as I found
      afterwards, did I see it now. It was soon explained. Miss Gomme, Mlle.
      Montmoulin, and Miss Planta, all dined with Mrs. Schwellenberg to-day. The
      moment I joined them, Mrs. Schwellenberg called out,&mdash;&ldquo;Pray,
      Miss Berner, for what visit you the gentlemen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you,&mdash;and for what, I say?"<span class="pagenum">296</span><a
      name="link296" id="link296"></a> Amazed, I declared I did not know what
      she meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O,&rdquo; cried she, scoffingly, &ldquo;that won&rsquo;t not do!&mdash;we
      all saw you,&mdash;princess royal the same,&mdash;so don&rsquo;t not say
      that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I stared,-and Miss Gomme burst out in laughter, and then Mrs.
      Schwellenberg added,&mdash;&ldquo;For what go you over to the Prince of
      Wales his house?&mdash;nobody lives there but the gentlemen,&mdash;nobody
      others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed too, now, and told her the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;Lady Charlotte!&mdash;ver true. I had
      forgot Lady Charlotte!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, very well, imagine,&rdquo; cried I,&mdash;&ldquo;so only the
      gentlemen were remembered!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I then found this had been related to the queen; and Mlle. Montmoulin said
      she supposed the visit had been to General Gordon!&mdash;He is the groom
      now in waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed an open raillery from Mlle. Montmoulin of Mr. Fairly&rsquo;s
      visits; but I stood it very well, assuring her I should never seek to get
      rid of my two prison-visitors, Mr. Smelt and Mr. Fairly, till I Could
      replace them by better, or go abroad for others.

      Feb. 14.&mdash;The king is infinitely better. O that there were patience
      in the land! and this Regency Bill postponed. Two of the princesses
      regularly, and in turn, attend their royal mother in her evening visits to
      the king. Some of those who stay behind now and then spend the time in
      Mrs. Schwellenberg&rsquo;s room. They all long for their turn of going to
      the king, and count the hours till it returns. Their dutiful affection is
      truly beautiful to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      This evening the Princesses Elizabeth and Mary came into Mrs.
      Schwellenberg&rsquo;s room while I was yet there. They sang songs in two
      parts all the evening, and vary prettily in point of voice. Their good
      humour, however, and inherent condescension and sweetness of manners,
      would make a much worse performance pleasing.

      Feb. 16-All well, and the king is preparing for an interview with the
      chancellor Dr. Willis now confides in me all his schemes and notions; we

    <p>
      When I came to tea, I found Mr. Fairly waiting in my room. He had left Kew
      for Richmond park, but only dined there. We had much discussion of state
      business. The king is SO much himself, that he is soon to be informed of
      the general situation of the kingdom. O what an information!&mdash;how we
      all tremble in looking forward to it., Mr. Fairly thinks Mr. Smelt the
      fittest man for this office; Mr. Smelt thinks the same of Mr. Fairly: both
      have told me this.

      Mr. Fairly began soon to look at his watch, complaining very much of the
      new ceremony imposed, of this attendance of handing the Queen, which, he
      said, broke into his whole evening. Yet he does as little as possible.
      &ldquo;The rest of them,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;think it necessary to wait
      in an adjoining apartment during the whole interview, to be ready to show
      themselves when it is over!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He now sat with his watch in his hand, dreading to pass his time, but
      determined not to anticipate its occupation, till half past nine o&rsquo;clock,
      when he drew on his white gloves, ready for action. But then, stopping
      short, he desired me to guess whom, amongst my acquaintance, he had met in
      London this last time of his going thither. I could not guess whom he
      meant&mdash;but I saw it was no common person, by his manner. He then
      continued&mdash;&ldquo;A tall, thin, meagre, sallow, black-eyed,
      penetrating, keen-looking figure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I could still not guess,&mdash;and he named Mr. Windham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Windham!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;no, indeed,&mdash;you do
      not describe him fairly,&mdash;he merits better colouring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He accuses me of being very partial to him: however, I am angry enough
      with him just now, though firmly persuaded still, that whatever has fallen
      from him, that is wrong and unfeeling on the subject of the Regency, has
      been the effect of his enthusiastic friendship for Mr. Burke: for he has
      never risen, on this cruel business, but in Support of that most misguided
      of Vehement and wild orators. This I have observed in the debates, and
      felt that Mr. Burke was not more run away with by violence of temper, and
      passion, than Mr. Windham by excess of friendship and admiration.<span
      class="pagenum">298</span><a name="link298" id="link298"></a> Mr. Fairly
      has, I fancy, been very intimate with him, for he told me he observed he
      was passing him, in Queen Anne Street, and stopped his horse, to call out,
      &ldquo;O ho, Windham! so I see you will not know me with this servant!&rdquo;
      He was on business of the queen&rsquo;s, and had one of the royal grooms
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Windham laughed, and said he was very glad to see who it was, for, on
      looking at the royal servant, he had just been going to make his lowest
      bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I thank you!&rdquo; returned Mr. Fairly, &ldquo;you took me,
      then, for the Duke of Cumberland.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE KING CONTINUES TO IMPROVE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Feb. 17.&mdash;The times are now most interesting and critical. Dr. Willis
      confided to me this morning that to-day the king is to see the chancellor.
      How important will be the result of his appearance!&mdash;the whole
      national fate depends upon it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Feb. 18.&mdash;I had this morning the highest gratification, the purest
      feelings of delight, I have been regaled with for many months: I saw, from
      the road, the king and queen, accompanied by Dr. Willis, walking in
      Richmond gardens, near the farm, arm in arm!&mdash;It was a pleasure that
      quite melted me, after a separation so bitter, scenes so distressful-to
      witness such harmony and security! Heaven bless and preserve them was all
      I could incessantly say while I kept in their sight. I was in the carriage
      with Mrs. Schwellenberg at the time. They saw us also, as I heard
      afterwards from the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening Mrs. Arline, Mrs. Schwellenberg&rsquo;s maid, came into
      Mrs. Schwellenberg&rsquo;s room, after coffee, and said to me, &ldquo;If
      you please, ma&rsquo;am, somebody wants you.&rdquo; I concluded this
      somebody my shoemaker, or the like; but in my room I saw Mr. Fairly. He
      was in high spirits. He had seen his majesty; Dr. Willis had carried him
      in. He was received with open arms, and embraced; he found nothing now
      remaining of the disorder, but too in much hurry of spirits. When he had
      related the particulars of the interview, he suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;How
      amazingly well you have borne all this!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I made some short answers, and would have taken-refuge in some other
      topic: but he seemed bent upon pursuing his own, and started various
      questions and surmises, to draw me on, In vain, however; I gave but
      general, or evasive answers,<span class="pagenum">299</span><a

    <h2>
      THE KING&rsquo;S HEALTH IS COMPLETELY RESTORED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This was a sweet, and will prove a most memorable day: Regency was put
      off, in the House of Lords, by a motion from the chancellor!&mdash;huzza!
      huzza! And this evening, for the first time, the king came upstairs, to
      drink tea with the queen and princesses in the drawing-room! My heart was
      so full of joy and thankfulness, I could hardly breathe! Heaven&mdash;heaven
      be praised! What a different house is this house become!&mdash;sadness and
      terror, that wholly occupied it so lately, are now flown away, or rather
      are now driven out; and though anxiety still forcibly prevails, &rsquo;tis
      in so small a proportion to joy and thankfulness, that it is borne as if
      scarce an ill!
    </p>
    <p>
      Feb. 23.&mdash;This morning opened wofully to me, though gaily to the
      house; for as my news of his majesty was perfectly comfortable, I
      ventured, in direct words, to ask leave to receive my dear friends Mr. and
      Mrs. Locke, who were now in town:&mdash;in understood sentences, and open
      looks, I had already failed again and again. My answer was&mdash;&ldquo;I
      have no particular objection, only you&rsquo;ll keep them to your room.&rdquo;
      Heavens!&mdash;did they ever, unsummoned, quit it? or have they any wish
      to enlarge their range of visit? I was silent, and then heard a history of
      some imprudence in Lady Effingham, who had received some of her friends.
      My resolution, upon this, I need not mention: I preferred the most
      lengthened absence to such a permission. But I felt it acutely! and I
      hoped, at least, that by taking no steps, something more favourable might
      soon pass....
    </p>
    <p>
      The king I have seen again in the queen&rsquo;s dressing-room. On opening
      the door, there he stood! He smiled at my start, and saying he had waited
      on purpose to see me, added, &ldquo;I am quite well now,&mdash;I was
      nearly so when I saw you before, but I could overtake you better now.&rdquo;
      And then he left the room. I was quite melted with joy and thankfulness at
      this so entire restoration.

      THE KING&rsquo;S REAPPEARANCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kew Palace, Sunday, March 1.&mdash;What a pleasure was mine this morning!
      how solemn, but how grateful! The queen gave me the &ldquo;Prayer of
      Thanksgiving&rdquo; upon the king&rsquo;s recovery. It was this morning
      read in all the churches throughout the metropolis, and by this day week
      it will reach every church in the kingdom. It kept me in tears all the
      morning,&mdash;that such a moment should actually arrive! after fears so
      dreadful, scenes so terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen gave me a dozen to distribute among the female servants: but I
      reserved one of them for dear Mr. Smelt, who took it from me in speechless
      extacy&mdash;his fine and feeling eyes swimming in tears of joy. There is
      no describing&mdash;and I will not attempt it&mdash;the fullness, the
      almost overwhelming fullness of this morning&rsquo;s thankful feelings!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the great gratification to see the honoured object of this joy, for
      a few minutes, in the queen&rsquo;s dressing-room. He was all calmness and
      benevolent graciousness. I fancied my strong emotion had disfigured me; or
      perhaps the whole of this long confinement and most affecting winter may
      have somewhat marked my countenance; for the king presently said to me,
      &ldquo;Pray, are you quite well to-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not quite, sir,&rdquo; I answered, <span class="pagenum">301</span><a
      name="link301" id="link301"></a> &ldquo;She does not look well,&rdquo;
      said he to the queen; &ldquo;she looks a little yellow, I think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How kind, to think of anybody and their looks, at this first moment of
      reappearance!

    <h2>
      AN AIRING AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wednesday, March 4.&mdash;A message from Mrs. Schwellenberg this morning,
      to ask me to air with her, received my most reluctant acquiescence; for
      the frost is so severe that any air, without exercise, is terrible to me;
      though, were her atmosphere milder, the rigour of the season I might not
      regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we came to the passage the carriage was not ready. She murmured most
      vehemently; and so bitterly cold was I, I could heartily have joined, had
      it answered any purpose. In this cold passage we waited in this miserable
      manner a full quarter of an hour; Mrs. Schwellenberg all the time scolding
      the servants, threatening them With exile, sending message after message,
      repining, thwarting, and contentious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we were to go, and wait in the king&rsquo;s rooms&mdash;now in the
      gentlemen&rsquo;s&mdash;now in Dr. Willis&rsquo;s&mdash;her own&mdash;and
      this, in the end, took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our way we encountered Mr. Fairly. He asked where we were going.
      &ldquo;To my own parlour!&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accompanied us in; and, to cheer the gloom, seized some of the stores
      of Dr. Willis,&mdash;sandwiches, wine and water, and other refreshments,&mdash;and
      brought them to us, one after another in a sportive manner, recommending
      to us to break through common rules, on such an occasion, and eat and
      drink to warm ourselves. Mrs. Schwellenberg stood in stately silence, and
      bolt upright, scarce deigning to speak even a refusal; till, upon his
      saying, while he held a glass of wine in his hand, &ldquo;Come, ma&rsquo;am,
      do something eccentric for once&mdash;it will warm you,&rdquo; she angrily
      answered, &ldquo;You been reely&mdash;what you call&mdash;too much
      hospital!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of us could help laughing. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;with
      the goods of others;&mdash;that makes a wide difference in hospitality!&rdquo;
      Then he rattled away upon the honours the room had lately received, of
      having had Mr. Pitt, the Chancellor, Archbishop of Canterbury, etc., to
      wait in it. This she resented highly, as seeming to think it more honoured
      in her absence than presence.<span class="pagenum">302</span><a
      name="link302" id="link302"></a> At length we took our miserable airing,
      in which I was treated with as much fierce harshness as if I was being
      conveyed to some place of confinement for the punishment Of some dreadful
      offence!
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have the glass down on my side; the piercing wind cut my face; I
      put my muff up to it: this incensed her so much, that she vehemently
      declared &ldquo;she never, no never would trobble any won to air with her
      again but go always selfs.&rdquo;&mdash;And who will repine at that?
      thought I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet by night I had caught a violent cold, which flew to my face, and
      occasioned me dreadful pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      March 10.&mdash;I have been in too much pain to write these last five
      days; and I became very feverish, and universally ill, affected with the
      fury of the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      My royal mistress, who could not but observe me very unwell, though I have
      never omitted my daily three attendances, which I have performed with a
      difficulty all but insurmountable, concluded I had been guilty of some
      imprudence: I told the simple fact of the glass,&mdash;but quite simply,
      and without one circumstance. She instantly said she was surprised I could
      catch cold in an airing, as it never appeared that it disagreed with me
      when I took it with Mrs. Delany.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I immediately answered, &ldquo;nor with
      Mrs. Locke; nor formerly with Mrs. Thrale:&mdash;but they left me the
      regulation of the glass on my own side to myself; or, if they interfered,
      it was to draw it up for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This I could not resist. I can be silent; but when challenged to speak at
      all, it must be plain truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no answer. Illness here&mdash;till of late&mdash;has been so
      unknown, that it is commonly supposed it must be wilful, and therefore
      meets little notice, till accompanied by danger, or incapacity of duty.
      This is by no means from hardness of heart-far otherwise; there is no
      hardness of heart in any one of them; but it is prejudice and want of
      personal experience.

      March 10.&mdash;This was a day of happiness indeed!&mdash;a day of such
      heartfelt public delight as Could not but suppress all private
      disturbance. The general illumination of all London proved the universal
      joy of a thankful and most affectionate people, who have shown so largely,
      on this trying occasion, how well they merited the monarch thus
      benignantly preserved. <span class="pagenum">303</span><a name="link303"

      When it was lighted and prepared, the Princess Amelia went to lead her

      MR FAIRLY ON MISS BURNEY&rsquo;S DUTIES.

    <p>
      Windsor, March 18.&mdash;A little rap announced Mr. Fairly, who came in,
      saying, &ldquo;I am escaped for a little while, to have some quiet
      conversation with you, before the general assemblage and storm of company.&rdquo;
      He then gravely said, &ldquo;Tomorrow I shall take leave of you&mdash;for

      He intended setting off to-morrow morning for town, by the opportunity of
      the equerries&rsquo; coach, which would convey him to Kew, where his
      majesty was to receive an address.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told me, with a good deal of humour, that he suspected me of being
      rather absent in my official occupation, from little natural care about
      toilettes and such things. I could not possibly deny this,&mdash;on the
      contrary, I owned I had, at first, found my attention unattainable, partly
      from flutter and embarrassment, and partly from the reasons he so
      discerningly assigned. &ldquo;I have even,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;and not
      seldom, handed her fan before her gown, and her gloves before her cap but
      I am better in all that now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think all that very likely,&rdquo; cried he, smiling;
      &ldquo;yet it is not very trifling with her majesty, who is so exact and
      precise, such things seem to her of moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This is truth itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, &ldquo;No,&mdash;she is more gracious, more kind, indeed, to me
      than ever: she scarce speaks, scarce turns to me without a smile.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried he, extremely pleased, &ldquo;this must much
      soften your employment and confinement. And, indeed, it was most natural
      to expect this time of distress should prove a cement.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A VISIT FROM MISS FUZILIER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I think I need not mention meeting my beloved Fredy in town, on our
      delightful excursion thither for the grand restoration Drawing-room, in
      which the queen received the compliments and congratulations of almost all
      the Court part of the nation. Miss Cambridge worked me, upon this
      occasion, a suit, in silks upon tiffany, most excessively delicate and
      pretty, and much admired by her majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      All I shall mention of this town visit is, that, the day after the great
      Drawing-room, Miss Fuzilier, for the first time since I have been in
      office, called upon me to inquire after the queen. Miss Tryon, and Mrs.
      Tracey, and Mrs. Fielding were with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked serious, sensible, interesting. I thought instantly of the
      report concerning Mr. Fairly, and of his disavowal: but it was singular
      that the only time she opened her mouth to speak was to name him! Miss
      Tryon, who chatted incessantly, had spoken of the great confusion at the
      Drawing-room, from the crowd: &ldquo;It was intended to be better
      regulated,&rdquo; said Miss <span class="pagenum">305</span><a
      name="link305" id="link305"></a> F., &ldquo;Mr. Fairly told me.&rdquo; She
      dropped her eye the moment she had spoken his name. After this, as before
      it, she said nothing. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. George Villiers, a younger brother of Lord Clarendon, was now here as
      groom of the bedchamber. He is very clever, somewhat caustigue, but so
      loyal and vehement in the king&rsquo;s cause, that he has the appellation,
      from his party, of &ldquo;The Tiger.&rdquo;

      He would not obtain it for his person, which is remarkably slim, slight,
      and delicate.

    <h2>
      A COMMAND FROM HER MAJESTY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kew, April, 1789. My dearest friends, I have her majesty&rsquo;s commands
      to inquire&mdash;whether you have any of a certain breed of poultry?
    </p>
    <p>
      N.B. What breed I do not remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to say she has just received a small group of the same herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      N.B. The quantity I have forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to add, she is assured they are something very rare and scarce, and
      extraordinary and curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      N.B. By whom she was assured I have not heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to subjoin, that you must send word if you have any of the same sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      N.B. How you are to find that out, I cannot tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to mention, as a corollary, that, if you have none of them, and should
      like to have some, she has a cock and a hen she can spare, and will
      appropriate them to Mr. Locke and my dearest Fredy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This conclusive stroke so pleased and exhilarated me, that forthwith I
      said you would both be enchanted, and so forgot all the preceding
      particulars. And I said, moreover, that I knew you would rear them, and
      cheer them, and fondle them like your children.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now-pray write a very fair answer fairly, in fair hand, and to her fair
      purpose.

    <h2>
      COLONEL MANNERS MYSTIFIES MRS. SCHWELLENBERG.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Queen&rsquo;s Lodge, Windsor, April.-Mrs. Schwellenberg is softened into
      nothing but civility and courtesy to me. To what the change is owing I
      cannot conjecture; but I do all that in me lies <span class="pagenum">306</span><a
      name="link306" id="link306"></a> to support it, preferring the entire
      sacrifice of every moment, from our dinner to twelve at night, to her
      harshness and horrors. Nevertheless, a lassitude of existence creeps
      sensibly upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Manners, however, for the short half-hour of tea-time, is
      irresistibly diverting. He continues my constant friend and neighbour,
      and, while he affects to play off the coadjutrix to advantage, he nods at
      me, to draw forth my laughter or approbation, with the most alarming
      undisguise. I often fear her being affronted; but naturally she admires
      him very much for his uncommon share of beauty, and makes much allowance
      for his levity. However, the never-quite-comprehended affair of the
      leather bed-cover,<a href="#linknote-306" name="linknoteref-306"
      id="linknoteref-306"><small>306</small></a> has in some degree intimidated
      her ever since, as she constantly apprehends that, if he were provoked, he
      would play her some trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been at White&rsquo;s ball, given in town upon his majesty&rsquo;s
      recovery. We begged some account of it: he ranted away with great fluency,
      uttering little queer sarcasms at Mrs. Schwellenberg by every opportunity,
      and colouring when he had done, with private fear of enraging her. This,
      however, she suspected not, or all his aim had been lost; for to alarm her
      is his delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I liked it all,&rdquo; he said, in summing up his relation, &ldquo;very
      well, except the music, and I like any caw-caw-caw, better than that sort
      of noise,&mdash;only you must not tell the king I say that, ma&rsquo;am,
      because the king likes it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She objected to the words &ldquo;must not,&rdquo; and protested she would
      not be directed by no one, and would tell it, if she pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, he began a most boisterous threatening of the evil consequences
      which would accrue to herself, though in so ludicrous a manner, that how
      she could suppose him serious was my wonder. &ldquo;Take care of yourself,
      ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he cried, holding up his finger as if menacing a
      child; &ldquo;take care of yourself! I am not to be provoked twice!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This, after a proud resistance, conquered her and, really frightened at
      she knew not what, she fretfully exclaimed, &ldquo;Ver well, sir!&mdash;I
      wish I had not come down! I won&rsquo;t no more! you might have your tea
      when you can get It.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to his account, he owned he had been rather a little musical
      himself for once, which was when they all sang &ldquo;God save the king,&rdquo;
      after the supper; for then he joined in<span class="pagenum">307</span><a
      name="link307" id="link307"></a> the chorus, as well and as loud as any of
      them, &ldquo;though some of the company,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;took the
      liberty to ask me not to be so loud, because they pretended I was out of
      tune; but it was in such a good cause that I did not mind that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was no sooner recovered than the attack became personal again; and so
      it has continued ever since: he seems bent upon &ldquo;playing her off&rdquo;
      in all manners; he braves her, then compliments her, assents to her
      opinion, and the next moment contradicts her; pretends uncommon friendship
      for her, and then laughs in her face. But his worst manoeuvre is a
      perpetual application to me, by looks and sly glances, which fill me with
      terror of passing for an accomplice; and the more, as I find it utterly
      impossible to keep grave during these absurdities. And yet, the most
      extraordinary part of the story is that she really likes him! though at
      times she is so angry, she makes vows to keep to her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. George Villiers, with far deeper aim, sneers out his own more artful
      satire, but is never understood; while Colonel Manners domineers with so
      high a hand, he carries all before him; and whenever Mrs. Schwellenberg,
      to lessen her mortification, draws me into the question, he instantly
      turns off whatever she begins into some high-flown compliment, so worded
      also as to convey some comparative reproach. This offends more than all.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she complains to me of him, in his absence, I answer he is a mere
      schoolboy, for mischief, without serious design of displeasing: but she
      tells me she sees he means to do her some harm, and she will let the king
      know, if he goes on at that rate, for she does not choose such sort of
      familiarness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once she apologised suddenly for her English, and Colonel Manners said,
      &ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t mind that, ma&rsquo;am, for I take no particular
      notice as to your language.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;Miss Berner might tell me, when I
      speak it sometimes not quite right, what you call.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear no, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; exclaimed he; &ldquo;Miss Burney is
      of too mild a disposition for that: she could not correct you strong
      enough to do you good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!-ver well, sir!&rdquo; she cried, confounded by his effrontery.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day she lamented she had been absent when there was so much agreeable
      company in the house; &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she <span class="pagenum">308</span><a
      name="link308" id="link308"></a> added, &ldquo;now that I am come back,
      here is nobody.&mdash;not one!&mdash;no society!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He protested this was not to be endured, and told her that to reckon all
      us nobody was so bad, he should resent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do, my good colonel?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O ma&rsquo;am, do?&mdash;I will tell Dr. Davis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who bin he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s the master of Eton school, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; with
      a thundering bawl in her ears, that made her stop them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; she cried, indignantly, &ldquo;I thank you for
      that, I won&rsquo;t have no Dr. schoolmaster, what you call! I bin too old
      for that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, ma&rsquo;am, he shall bring you a Latin oration upon this
      subject, and you must hear it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, &rsquo;tis all the same! I shan&rsquo;t not understand it, so I
      won&rsquo;t not hear it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must, ma&rsquo;am. If I write it, I shan&rsquo;t let you
      off so:&mdash;you must hear it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t!&mdash;Miss Berner might,&mdash;give it her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Miss Burney know Latin?&rdquo; cried Mr. G. Villiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one word,&rdquo; quoth I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that,&rdquo; cried she &ldquo;but she might hear it the
      same!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE SAILOR PRINCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the 2nd of May I met Colonel Manners, waiting at the corner of a
      passage leading towards the queen&rsquo;s apartments. &ldquo;Is the king,
      ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;there? because Prince William<a
      href="#linknote-307" name="linknoteref-307" id="linknoteref-307"><small>307</small></a>
      is come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had heard he was arrived in town, and with much concern, since it was
      without leave of the king. It was in the illness, indeed, of the king he
      sailed to England, and when he had probably all the excuse of believing
      his royal father incapable of further governance. How did I grieve for the
      feelings of that royal father, in this idea! yet it certainly offers for
      Prince William his best apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, while Mrs. Schwellenberg, Mrs. Zachary and myself were
      sitting in the eating parlour, the door was suddenly opened by Mr.
      Alberts, the queen&rsquo;s page, and &ldquo;prince William&rdquo; was
      announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to see Mrs. Schwellenberg. He is handsome, as<span class="pagenum">309</span><a
      name="link309" id="link309"></a> are all the royal family, though he is
      not of a height to be called a good figure. He looked very hard at the two
      strangers, but made us all sit, very civilly, and drew a chair for
      himself, and began to discourse with the most unbounded openness and
      careless ease, of everything that Occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schwellenberg said she had pitied him for the grief he must have felt
      at the news of the king&rsquo;s illness: &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried he,
      &ldquo;I was very sorry, for his majesty, very sorry indeed, no man loves
      the king better; of that be assured, but all sailors love their king. And
      I felt for the queen, too,&mdash;I did, faith. I was horridly agitated
      when I saw the king first. I could hardly stand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs. Schwellenberg suddenly said, &ldquo;Miss Berner, now you might
      see his royal highness; you wanted it so moch, and now you might do it.
      Your royal highness, that is Miss Berner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose very civilly, and bowed, to this strange freak of an introduction;
      and, of course, I rose and Curtsied low, and waited his commands to sit
      again; which were given instantly, with great courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;you have a brother in the
      service?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; I answered, much pleased with this professional
      attention. He had not, he civilly said, the pleasure to know him, but he
      had heard of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning suddenly to Mrs. Schwellenberg, &ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; cried
      he, &ldquo;what is become of Mrs.&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;Mrs. Hogentot?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, your royal highness!&rdquo; cried she, stifling much offence,
      &ldquo;do you mean the poor Haggerdorn?&mdash;O your royal highness! have
      you forgot her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, upon my word!&rdquo; cried he, plumply &ldquo;upon my soul,
      I have!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then turning again to me, &ldquo;I am very happy, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he
      cried, &ldquo;to see you here; it gives me great pleasure the queen should
      appoint the sister of a sea-officer to so eligible a situation. As long as
      she has a brother in the service, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; cried he to Mrs.
      Schwellenberg, &ldquo;I look upon her as one of us. O, faith I do! I do
      indeed! she is one of the corps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said he had been making acquaintance with a new princess, one he
      did not know nor remember&mdash;Princess Amelia. &ldquo;Mary, too,&rdquo;&mdash;he
      said, &ldquo;I had quite forgot; and they did not tell me who she was; so
      I went up to her, and, without in the least recollecting her, she&rsquo;s
      so monstrously grown, I said, &lsquo;Pray, ma&rsquo;am, are you one of the
      attendants?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Princess Sophia is his professed favourite. &ldquo;I have had the<span
      class="pagenum">310</span><a name="link310" id="link310"></a> honour,&rdquo;
      he cried, &ldquo;of about an hour&rsquo;s conversation with that young
      lady, in the old style; though I have given up my mad frolics now. To be
      sure, I had a few in that style formerly; upon my word I am almost
      ashamed;&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, recollecting particulars, he laughed vehemently; but Mrs.
      Schwellenberg eagerly interrupted his communications. I fancy some of them
      might have related to our own sacred person!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Augusta,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;looks very well,&mdash;a good face
      and countenance,&mdash;she looks interesting,&mdash;she looks as if she
      knew more than she would say; and I like that character.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed a full hour, chatting in this good-humoured and familiar manner.

    <h2>
      LOYAL RECEPTION OF THE KING IN THE NEW FOREST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thursday, June 25.&mdash;This morning I was called before five o&rsquo;clock,
      though various packages and business had kept me up till near three.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was rainy, but the road was beautiful; Windsor great park, in
      particular, is charming. The crowds increased as we advanced, and at
      Winchester the town was one head. I saw Dr. Warton, but could not stop the
      carriage. The king was everywhere received with acclamation. His
      popularity is greater than ever. Compassion for his late sufferings seems
      to have endeared him now to all conditions of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Romsey, on the steps of the town-hall, an orchestra was formed, and a
      band of musicians, in common brown coarse cloth and red neckcloths, and
      even in carters&rsquo; loose gowns, made a chorus of &ldquo;God save the
      king,&rdquo; In which the countless multitude joined, in such loud
      acclamation, that their loyalty and heartiness, and natural joy, almost
      surprised me into a sob before I knew myself at all affected by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New Forest Is all beauty, and when we approached Lyndhurst the crowds
      wore as picturesque an appearance as the landscapes; They were all in
      decent attire, and, the great space giving them full room, the cool beauty
      of the verdure between the groups took away all idea of inconvenience, and
      made their live gaiety a scene to joy beholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carriages of all sorts lined the road-side:-chariots, chaises, landaus,
      carts, waggons, whiskies, gigs, phatons&mdash;mixed and intermixed, filled
      Within and surrounded without by faces all glee and delight. <span
      class="pagenum">311</span><a name="link311" id="link311"></a> Such was the
      scenery for miles before we reached Lyndhurst. The old law of the forest,
      that his majesty must be presented with two milk-white greyhounds,
      peculiarly decorated, upon his entrance into the New Forest, gathered
      together multitudes to see the show. A party, also, of foresters, habited
      in green, and each with a bugle-horn, met his majesty at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at Lyndhurst, we drove to the Duke of Gloucester&rsquo;s. The
      royal family were just before us, but the two colonels came and handed us
      through the crowd. The house, intended for a mere hunting-seat, was built
      by Charles II., and seems quite unimproved and unrepaired from its first
      foundation. It is the king&rsquo;s, but lent to the Duke of Gloucester. It
      is a straggling, inconvenient, old house, but delightfully situated, in a
      village,&mdash;looking, indeed, at present, like a populous town, from the
      amazing concourse of people that have crowded into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bow-men and archers and bugle-horns are to attend the king while he
      stays here, in all his rides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Gloucester was ready to receive the royal family, who are all
      in the highest spirits and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a small old bed-chamber, but a large and commodious parlour, in
      which the gentlemen join Miss Planta and me to breakfast and to drink tea.
      They dine at the royal table. We are to remain here some days.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the king&rsquo;s dinner, which was in a parlour looking into the
      garden, he permitted the people to come to the window; and their delight
      and rapture in seeing their monarch at table, with the evident hungry
      feeling it occasioned, made a contrast of admiration and deprivation,
      truly comic. They crowded, however, so excessively, that this can be
      permitted them no more. They broke down all the paling, and much of the
      hedges, and some of the windows, and all by eagerness and multitude, for
      they were perfectly civil and well-behaved.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon the royal party came into my parlour; and the moment the
      people saw the star, they set up such a shout as made a ring all around
      the village; for my parlour has the same view with the royal rooms into
      the garden, where this crowd was assembled, and the new rapture was simply
      at seeing the king in a new apartment!
    </p>
    <p>
      They all walked out, about and around the village, in the evening, and the
      delighted mob accompanied them. The <span class="pagenum">312</span><a
      name="link312" id="link312"></a> moment they stepped out of the house, the
      people, With voice, struck up &ldquo;God save the king!&rdquo; I assure
      you I cried like a child twenty times in the day, at the honest and
      rapturous effusions of such artless and disinterested loyalty. The king&rsquo;s
      illness and recovery make me tender, as Count Mannuccia said, upon every
      recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      These good villagers continued singing this loyal song during the whole
      walk, without any intermission, except to shout &ldquo;huzza!&rdquo; at
      the end of every stanza. They returned so hoarse, that I longed to give
      them all some lemonade. Probably they longed for something they would have
      called better! &lsquo;Twas well the king could walk no longer; I think, if
      he had, they would have died singing around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      June 30.&mdash;We continued at Lyndhurst five days and the tranquillity of
      the life, and the beauty of the country, would have made it very regaling
      to me indeed, but for the fatigue of having no maid, yet being always in
      readiness to play the part of an attendant myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went twice to see the house of Sir Phillip Jennings Clerke, my old
      acquaintance at Streatham. I regretted he was no more; he would so much
      have prided and rejoiced in shewing his place. His opposition principles
      would not have interfered with that private act of duty from a subject to
      a sovereign. How did I call to mind Mrs. Thrale, upon this spot! not that
      I had seen it with her, or ever before; but that its late owner was one of
      her sincerest admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta and myself drove also to Southampton, by the queen&rsquo;s
      direction. It is a pretty clean town, and the views from the Southampton
      water are highly picturesque: but all this I had seen to far greater
      advantage, with Mr. and Mrs. and Miss Thrale. Ah, Mrs. Thrale!&mdash;In
      thinking her over, as I saw again the same spot, how much did I wish to
      see with it the same&mdash;once so dear&mdash;companion!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Sunday we all went to the parish church; and after the service,
      instead of a psalm, imagine our surprise to hear the whole congregation
      join in &ldquo;God save the king!&rdquo; Misplaced as this was in a
      church, its intent was so kind, loyal, and affectionate, that I believe
      there was not a dry eye amongst either singers or hearers. The king&rsquo;s
      late dreadful illness has rendered this song quite melting to me. This day
      we quitted Lyndhurst; not without regret, for so private is its situation,
      I could stroll about in its beautiful neighbourhood quite alone. <span
      class="pagenum">313</span><a name="link313" id="link313"></a> THE ROYAL
      JOURNEY TO WEYMOUTH.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey to Weymouth was one scene of festivity and rejoicing. The
      people were everywhere collected, and everywhere delighted. We passed
      through Salisbury, where a magnificent arch was erected, of festoons of
      flowers, for the king&rsquo;s carriage to pass under, and mottoed with
      &ldquo;The king restored,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Long live the king,&rdquo; in
      three divisions. The green bowmen accompanied the train thus far; and the
      clothiers and manufacturers here met it, dressed out in white loose
      frocks, flowers, and ribbons, with sticks or caps emblematically decorated
      from their several manufactories. And the acclamations with which the king
      was received amongst them&mdash;it was a rapture past description. At
      Blandford there was nearly the same ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      At every gentleman&rsquo;s seat which we passed, the owners and their
      families stood at the gate, and their guests Or neighbours were in
      carriages all round.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Dorchester the crowd seemed still increased. The city had so antique an
      air, I longed to investigate its old buildings. The houses have the most
      ancient appearance of any that are inhabited that I have happened to see:
      and inhabited they were indeed! every window-sash was removed, for face
      above face to peep Out, and every old balcony and all the leads of the
      houses seemed turned into booths for fairs. It seems, also, the most
      populous town I have seen; I judge by the concourse of the young and
      middle-aged&mdash;those we saw everywhere alike, as they may gather
      together from all quarters-but from the amazing quantity of indigenous
      residers; old women and young children. There seemed families of ten or
      twelve of the latter in every house; and the old women were so numerous,
      that they gave the whole scene the air of a rural masquerade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Girls, with chaplets, beautiful young creatures, strewed the entrance of
      various villages with flowers.

    <h2>
      WELCOME TO WEYMOUTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Gloucester House, which we now inhabit, at Weymouth, is Situated in front
      of the sea, and the sands of the bay before it are perfectly smooth and
      soft. The whole town, and Melcomb Regis, and half the county of Dorset,
      seemed assembled to welcome their majesties.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have here a very good parlour, but dull, from its aspect. <span
      class="pagenum">314</span><a name="link314" id="link314"></a> Nothing but
      the sea at Weymouth affords any life Or Spirit. My bed-room is in the
      attics. Nothing like living at a Court for exaltation. Yet even with this
      gratification, which extends to Miss Planta, the house will only hold the
      females of the party. The two adjoining houses are added, for the
      gentlemen, and the pages, and some other of the suite, cooks, etc.&mdash;but
      the footmen are obliged to lodge still farther off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bay is very beautiful, after its kind; a peninsula shuts out Portland
      island and the broad ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, and queen, and princesses, and their suite, walked out in the
      evening; an immense crowd attended them&mdash;sailors bargemen, mechanics,
      countrymen; and all united with so vociferous a volley of &ldquo;God save
      the king,&rdquo; that the noise was stunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      At near ten o&rsquo;clock Lord Courtown came into my parlour, as it is
      called, and said the town was all illuminated, and invited Miss Planta and
      me to a walk upon the sands. Their majesties were come in to supper. We
      took a stroll under his escort, and found it singularly beautiful, the
      night being very fine, and several boats and small vessels lighted up, and
      in motion upon the sea. The illumination extended through Melcomb Regis
      and Weymouth. Gloucester-row, in which we live, is properly in Melcomb
      Regis; but the two towns join each other, and are often confounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparations of festive loyalty were universal. Not a child could we
      meet that had not a bandeau round its head, cap, or hat, of &ldquo;God
      save the king;&rdquo; all the bargemen wore it in cockades and even the
      bathing-women had it in large coarse girdles round their waists. It is
      printed in golden letters upon most of the bathing-machines, and in
      various scrolls and devices it adorns every shop and almost every house in
      the two towns.

    <h2>
      THE ROYAL PLUNGE WITH MUSICAL HONOURS. &ldquo;YOU MUST KNEEL, SIR!&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      Gloucester House, Weymouth, Wednesday, July 9.&mdash;We are settled here
      comfortably enough. Miss Planta and I breakfast as well as dine together
      alone; the gentlemen have a breakfast parlour in the adjoining house, and
      we meet only at tea, and seldom then. They have all acquaintance here, in
      this Gloucester-row, and stroll from the terrace or the sands, to visit
      them during the tea vacation time. <span class="pagenum">315</span><a
      name="link315" id="link315"></a>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I like this much: I see them just enough to keep up sociability, without
      any necessary constraint; for I attend the tea-table only at my own hour,
      and they come, or not, according to chance or their convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king bathes, and with great success; a machine follows the royal one
      into the sea, filled with fiddlers, who play &ldquo;God save the king,&rdquo;
      as his majesty takes his plunge!
    </p>
    <p>
      I am delighted with the soft air and soft footing upon the sands, and
      stroll up and down them morning, noon, and night. As they are close before
      the house, I can get to and from them in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her majesty has graciously hired a little maid between Miss Planta and me,
      who comes for the day. We have no accommodation for her sleeping here; but
      it is an unspeakable relief to our personal fatigues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Gisburne is here, to attend his majesty; and the queen has ordered me
      to invite him to dine at my table. He comes regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Fanny Burney to Dr. Burney.) Gloucester Rowe, Weymouth, July 13, 1789. My
      dearest padre&rsquo;s kind letter was most truly welcome to me. When I am
      so distant, the term of absence or of silence seems always doubly long to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bay here is most beautiful; the sea never rough, generally calm and
      gentle, and the sands perfectly smooth and pleasant. I have not bathed,
      for I have had a cold in my head, which I caught at Lyndhurst, and which
      makes me fear beginning; but I have hopes to be well enough to-morrow, and
      thenceforward to ail nothing more. It is my intention to cast away all
      superfluous complaints into the main ocean, which I think quite
      sufficiently capacious to hold them; and really my little frame will find
      enough to carry and manage without them....
    </p>
    <p>
      His majesty is in delightful health, and much-improved spirits. All agree
      he never looked better. The loyalty of all this place is excessive; they
      have dressed out every street with labels of &ldquo;God save the king:&rdquo;
      all the shops have it over the doors: all the children wear it in their
      caps, all the labourers in their hats, and all the sailors in their
      voices, for they never approach the house without shouting it aloud, nor
      see the king, or his shadow, without beginning to huzza, and going on to
      three cheers. <span class="pagenum">316</span><a name="link316"
      id="link316"></a> The bathing-machines make it their motto over the
      windows; and those bathers that belong to the royal dippers wear it in
      bandeaus on their bonnets, to go into the sea; and have it again, in large
      letters, round their waists, to encounter the waves. Flannel dresses,
      tucked up, and no shoes nor stockings, with bandeaus and girdles, have a
      most singular appearance, and when first I surveyed these loyal nymphs it
      was with some difficulty I kept my features in order. Nor is this all.
      Think but Of the Surprise of his majesty when, the first time of his
      bathing, he had no sooner popped his royal head under water than a band of
      music, concealed in a neighbouring machine, struck up &ldquo;God save
      great George our king.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing, however, was a little unlucky,&mdash;when the mayor and
      burgesses came with the address, they requested leave to kiss hands: this
      was graciously accorded; but, the mayor advancing, in a common way, to
      take the queen&rsquo;s hand, as he might that of any lady mayoress,
      Colonel Gwynn, who stood by, whispered, &ldquo;You must kneel, sir!&rdquo;
      He found, however, that he took no notice of this hint, but kissed the
      queen&rsquo;s hand erect. As he passed him, in his way back, the colonel
      Said, &ldquo;You should have knelt, Sir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered the poor mayor, &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody does, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&mdash;I have a wooden leg!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor man! &rsquo;twas such a surprise! and such an excuse as no one could
      dispute. But the absurdity of the matter followed&mdash;all the rest did
      the same; taking the same privilege, by the example, without the same or
      any cause!

    <h2>
      ROYAL DOINGS IN AND ABOUT WEYMOUTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      July 15.&mdash;The Magnificent, a man-of-war Of 74 guns, commanded by an
      old captain of James&rsquo;s (Onslow), is now stationed at the entrance of
      the bay, for the security at once and pleasure of the king; and a fine
      frigate, the Southampton, Captain Douglas, is nearer in, and brought for
      the king to cruise about. Captain Douglas is nephew to Sir Andrew Snape
      Hammond, who married a cousin of our Mr. Crisp. The king and royal party
      have been to visit the frigate. Miss Planta and myself went to see the
      ceremony from a place called the Look-out,&mdash;a beautiful spot. But I
      have not much taste for sea receptions and honours: the firing a salute is
      SO strange a mode of hospitality and politeness.... <span class="pagenum">317</span><a
      name="link317" id="link317"></a> Mrs. Gwynn<a href="#linknote-308"
      name="linknoteref-308" id="linknoteref-308"><small>308</small></a> is
      arrived, and means to spend the royal season here. She lodges at the hotel
      just by, and we have met several times. She is very soft and pleasing, and
      still as beautiful as an angel. We have had two or three long tête-a-têtes
      and talked over, with great pleasure, anecdotes Of Our former mutual
      acquaintances&mdash;Dr. Johnson, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mrs. Thrale,
      Baretti, Miss Reynolds, Miss Palmer, and her old admirer, Dr. Goldsmith,
      of whom she relates&mdash;as who does not?&mdash;a thousand ridiculous
      traits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen is reading Mrs. Piozzi&rsquo;s tour<a href="#linknote-309"
      name="linknoteref-309" id="linknoteref-309"><small>309</small></a> to me,
      instead of my reading it to her. She loves reading aloud, and in this work
      finds me an able commentator. How like herself, how characteristic is
      every line&mdash;Wild, entertaining, flighty, inconsistent, and clever!
    </p>
    <p>
      July 16.&mdash;Yesterday we all went to the theatre. The king has taken
      the centre front box for himself, family, and attendants. The side boxes
      are too small. The queen ordered places for Miss Planta and me, which are
      in the front row of a box next but one to the royals. Thus, in this case,
      Our want of rank to be in their public suite gives us better seats than
      those high enough to stand behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Sydney, Lady Courtown&rsquo;s sister, and Miss Townshend, her
      daughter, are in the intermediate box, and were very sociable. I have met
      them here occasionally, and like them very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tis a pretty little theatre: but its entertainment was quite in the barn
      style a mere medley,&mdash;songs, dances, imitations, and all very bad.
      But Lord Chesterfield, who is here, and who seems chief director, promises
      all will be better.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning the royal party went to Dorchester, and I strolled upon the
      sands with Mrs. Gwynn. We overtook a lady, of a very majestic port and
      demeanour, who solemnly returned Mrs. Gwynn&rsquo;s salutation, and then
      addressed herself to me with similar gravity. I saw a face I knew, and of
      very uncommon beauty; but did not immediately recollect it was Mrs.
      Siddons. She is come here, she says, solely for her health: she has spent
      some days with Mrs. Gwynn, at General Harcourt&rsquo;s. Her husband was
      with her, and a sweet child. I wished to have tried if her solemnity would
      have worn away <span class="pagenum">318</span><a name="link318"
      id="link318"></a> by length of conversation; but I was obliged to hasten
      home. But my dearest Fredy&rsquo;s opinion, joined to that of my Sister
      Esther, satisfies me I was a loser by this necessary forbearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday, July 26.&mdash;Yesterday we went again to the play, and saw
      &ldquo;The Midnight Hour&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Commissary.&rdquo; The
      latter from the &ldquo;Bourgeois Gentilhomme,&rdquo; is comic to
      convulsion and the burlesque of Quick and Mrs. Wells united made me laugh
      quite immoderately.<a href="#linknote-310" name="linknoteref-310"
      id="linknoteref-310"><small>310</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      July 29.&mdash;We went to the play, and saw Mrs. Siddons in Rosalind. She
      looked beautifully, but too large for that shepherd&rsquo;s dress; and her
      gaiety sits not naturally upon her,&mdash;it seems more like disguised
      gravity. I must own my admiration for her confined to her tragic powers;
      and there it is raised so high that I feel mortified, in a degree, to see
      her so much fainter attempts and success in comedy.

    <h2>
      A PATIENT AUDIENCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Monday, Aug. 3.&mdash;The whole royal party went to see Lulworth Castle,
      intending to be back to dinner, and go to the play at night, which their
      majesties had ordered, with Mrs. Siddons to play Lady Townly.<a
      href="#linknote-311" name="linknoteref-311" id="linknoteref-311"><small>311</small></a>
      Dinner-time, however, came and passed, and they arrived not. They went by
      sea, and the wind proved contrary; and about seven o&rsquo;clock a hobby
      groom was despatched thither by land, with intelligence that they had only
      reached Lulworth Castle at five o&rsquo;clock. They meant to be certainly
      back by eight; but sent their commands that the farce might be performed
      first, and the play wait them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager repeated this to the audience,&mdash;already waiting and
      wearied but a loud applause testified their agreeability to whatever could
      be proposed. The farce, however, was much sooner over than the passage
      from Lulworth Castle. It was ten o&rsquo;clock when they landed! And all
      this time the audience&mdash;spectators rather&mdash;quietly waited!
    </p>
    <p>
      They landed, just by the theatre, and went to the house of Lady Pembroke,
      who is now here in attendance upon the queen: and there they Sent home for
      the king&rsquo;s page, with<span class="pagenum">319</span><a
      name="link319" id="link319"></a> a wig, etc.; and the queen&rsquo;s
      wardrobe woman, with similar decorations; and a message to Miss Planta and
      me, that we might go at once to the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      We obeyed; and soon after they appeared, and were received with the most
      violent gusts of joy and huzzas, even from the galleries over their heads,
      whose patience had not the reward of seeing them at last. Is not this a
      charming trait of provincial popularity?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Siddons, in her looks, and the tragic part, was exquisite.

    <h2>
      A FATIGUING BUT PLEASANT DAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aug. 4.&mdash;To-day all the royals went to Sherborne Castle. My day being
      perfectly at liberty, Mrs. Gwynn stayed and spent it with me. The weather
      was beautiful; the sea-breezes here keep off intense heat in the warmest
      season. We walked first to see the shrubbery and plantation of a lady,
      Mrs. B&mdash;, who has a very pretty house about a mile and a half out of
      the town. Here we rested, and regaled ourselves with sweet flowers, and
      then proceeded to the old castle,-its ruins rather, which we most
      completely examined, not leaving one stone&rsquo; untrod, except such as
      must have precipitated us into the sea. This castle is built almost in the
      sea, upon a perpendicular rock, and its situation, therefore, is nobly
      bold and striking. It is little more now than walls, and a few little
      winding staircases at its four corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not imagined my beautiful companion could have taken so much
      pleasure from an excursion so romantic and lonely; but she enjoyed it very
      much, clambered about as unaffectedly as if she had lived in rural scenes
      all her life, and left nothing unexamined.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then prowled along the sands at the foot of the adjoining rocks, and
      picked up sea-weeds and shells but I do not think they were such as to
      drive Sir Ashton Lever,<a href="#linknote-312" name="linknoteref-312"
      id="linknoteref-312"><small>312</small></a> or the Museum keepers, to
      despair! We had the queen&rsquo;s two little dogs, Badine and Phillis, for
      our guards and associates. We returned home to a very late tea, thoroughly
      tired, but very much pleased. To me it was the only rural excursion I had
      taken for more than three years. <span class="pagenum">320</span><a
      name="link320" id="link320"></a> The royal party came not home till past
      eleven o&rsquo;clock. The queen was much delighted with Sherborne Castle,
      which abounds with regal curiosities, honourably acquired by the family.

    <h2>
      LULWORTH CASTLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aug. 8.&mdash;-To-day we went to Lulworth Castle; but not with Mrs. Gwynn.
      Her majesty ordered our royal coach and four, and directed me to take the
      two De Lucs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lulworth Castle is beautifully situated, with a near and noble view of the
      sea, It has a spacious and very fine park, and commands a great extent of
      prospect. It is the property of Mr. Weld, a Roman Catholic, whose eldest
      brother was first husband of Mrs. Fitzherbert.<a href="#linknote-313"
      name="linknoteref-313" id="linknoteref-313"><small>313</small></a> A
      singular circumstance, that their majesties should visit a house in which,
      so few years ago, she might have received them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is in it a Roman Catholic chapel that is truly elegant,&mdash;a
      Pantheon in miniature,&mdash;and ornamented with immense expense and
      richness. The altar is all of finest variegated marbles, and precious
      stones are glittering from every angle. The priests&rsquo; vestments,
      which are very superb, and all the sacerdotal array, were shown us as
      particular favours: and Colonel Goldsworthy comically said he doubted not
      they had incense and oblations for a week to come, by way of purification
      for our heretical curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The castle is built with four turrets. It is not very ancient, and the
      inside is completely modern, and fitted up with great elegance. It abounds
      in pictures of priests, saints, monks, and nuns, and is decorated with
      crosses and Roman Catholic devices without end. They show one room in
      which two of our kings have slept; Charles II. and poor James II.
    </p>
    <p>
      We returned home to dinner, and in the evening went to the<span
      class="pagenum">321</span><a name="link321" id="link321"></a> play. Mrs.
      Siddons performed Mrs. Oakley. What
      pity thus to throw away her talents! but the queen dislikes tragedy, and
      the honour to play before the royal family blinds her to the little credit
      acquired by playing comedy.

    <h2>
      THE ROYAL PARTY AT THE ASSEMBLY ROOMS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sunday, Aug 9.&mdash;The king had a council yesterday, which brought most
      of the great officers of state to Weymouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, her majesty desired Miss Planta and me to go to the rooms,
      whither they commonly go themselves on Sunday evenings, and, after looking
      round them, and speaking where they choose, they retire to tea in an inner
      apartment with their own party, but leave the door wide open, both to see
      and be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rooms are convenient and spacious: we found them very full. As soon as
      the royal party came, a circle was formed, and they moved round it, just
      as before the ball at St. James&rsquo;s, the king one way with his
      chamberlain, the new-made Marquis of Salisbury, and the queen the other
      with the princesses, Lady Courtown, etc. The rest of the attendants
      planted themselves round in the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had now the pleasure, for the first time, to see Mr. Pitt but his
      appearance is his least recommendation; it is neither noble nor
      expressive. Lord Chatham, the Duke of Richmond, Mr. Villiers, Lord
      Delawarr, etc., were in the circle, and spoken to a long time each.

    <h2>
      A JOURNEY To EXETER AND SALTRAM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thursday, Aug. 13.&mdash;We began our Western tour. We all went in the
      same order as we set out from Windsor. We arrived at Exeter to a very late
      dinner. We were lodged at the Deanery; and Dr. Buller, the dean, desired a
      conference with me, for we came first, leaving the royals at Sir George
      Young&rsquo;s. He was very civil, and in highest glee: I had never seen
      him before; but he told me he introduced himself, by this opportunity, at
      the express desire of Mrs. Chapone and Mrs. Castle, who were both his
      relations, as well as of Dr. Warton. I was glad to hear myself yet
      remembered by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowds, the rejoicings, the hallooing, and singing, and garlanding,
      and decorating of all the inhabitants of this old <span class="pagenum">322</span><a
      name="link322" id="link322"></a> city, and of all the country through
      which we passed, made the journey quite charming: such happy loyalty as
      beamed from all ranks and descriptions of men carried close to the heart
      in sympathetic joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We passed all the next day at the Deanery, which was insufficient to our
      party, that not only the gentlemen, one and all, lodged at the hotel, but
      even Lady Courtown and the two Lady Waldegraves. I saw nothing of any of
      them while we stayed at Exeter. I strolled with Miss Planta about the
      town, which is populous and busy enough, but close and ugly. The principal
      parade for company, however, takes in a fine view of the country; and the
      cathedral is old and curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, Saturday the 15th, we quitted Exeter, in which there had
      been one constant mob surrounding the Deanery from the moment of our
      entrance. We proceeded through a country the most fertile, varied, rural,
      and delightful, in England, till we came to the end of our aim, Saltram.
      We passed through such beautiful villages, and so animated a concourse of
      people, that the whole journey proved truly delectable. Arches of flowers
      were-erected for the royal family to pass under at almost every town, with
      various loyal devices, expressive of their satisfaction in this circuit.
      How happy must have been the king!-how deservedly! The greatest conqueror
      could never pass through his dominions with fuller acclamations of joy
      from his devoted subjects than George III. experienced, simply from having
      won their love by the even tenor of an unspotted life, which, at length,
      has vanquished all the hearts of all his subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our entrance at Saltram was, personally to Miss Planta and me, very
      disagreeable: we followed immediately after the royals and equerries and
      so many of the neighbouring gentry, the officers, etc., were assembled to
      receive them, that we had to make our way through a crowd of starers the
      most tremendous, while the royals all stood at the windows, and the other
      attendants in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house is one of the most magnificent in the kingdom. It accommodated
      us all, even to every footman, without by any means filling the whole. The
      state apartments on the ground floor are superb, hung with crimson damask,
      and ornamented with pictures, some few of the Spanish school, the rest by
      Sir Joshua Reynolds, Angelica, and some few by other artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its view is noble; it extends to Plymouth, Mount Edgecumbe,<span
      class="pagenum">323</span><a name="link323" id="link323"></a> and the
      neighbouring fine country. The sea at times fills up a part of the domain
      almost close to the house, and then its prospect is Complete.

    <h2>
      MAY &ldquo;ONE&rdquo; COME IN?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sunday, Aug. 16.&mdash;Lord Courtown brought me a very obliging message
      from Lady Mount-Edgecumbe, who had been here at noon to kiss hands, on
      becoming a countess from a baroness. She sent to invite me to see her
      place, and contrive to dine and spend the day there. Her majesty approves
      the Mount-Edgecumbe invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aug. 18.&mdash;This morning the royals were all at a grand naval review. I
      spent the time very serenely in my favourite wood, which abounds in seats
      of all sorts and then I took a fountain Pen, and wrote my rough journal
      for copying to my dear Sorelle.<a href="#linknote-314"
      name="linknoteref-314" id="linknoteref-314"><small>314</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, Lord Courtown, opening my parlour door, called out,
      &ldquo;May one come in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May one?&rdquo; exclaimed Colonel Goldsworthy; &ldquo;may two, may
      three,&mdash;may four?&mdash;I like your one, indeed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And in they all entered, and remained in sociable conversation till they
      were all called, late, to cards.

    <h2>
      AN EXCURSION To PLYMOUTH DOCKYARD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aug. 19.&mdash;Again this morning was spent by the royals at Plymouth dock&mdash;by
      me in strolls round the house. The wood here is truly enchanting&mdash;the
      paths on the slant down to the water resemble those of sweet Norbury park.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea, also, was too much the same to be worth detailing. I will only
      mention a speech which could not but divert me, of Mr. Alberts, the queen&rsquo;s
      page. He said nobody dared represent to the king the danger of his present
      continual exertion in this hot weather,&mdash;&ldquo;unless it is Mr.
      Fairly,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;who can say anything, in his genteel
      roundabout way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aug. 21.&mdash;To-day the royals went to Mount-Edgecumbe, and her majesty
      had commissioned Lady Courtown to arrange a plan for Miss Planta and me to
      see Plymouth Dock. According, therefore, to her ladyship&rsquo;s
      directions, we set off for that place, and, after a dull drive of about
      five miles, arrived at the house of the commissioner, Admiral La Forey.
      Here <span class="pagenum">324</span><a name="link324" id="link324"></a>
      Mrs. La Forey and her daughters were prepared to expect us, and take the
      trouble of entertaining us for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three large and populous towns, Plymouth, Stockton, and Dock,<a
      href="#linknote-315" name="linknoteref-315" id="linknoteref-315"><small>315</small></a>
      nearly join each other. Plymouth is long, dirty, ill built, and wholly
      unornamented with any edifice worth notice. Stockton is rather
      neater,-nothing more. Dock runs higher and Is newer, and looks far cleaner
      and more habitable. The commissioner&rsquo;s is the best-situated house in
      Dock: it is opposite a handsome quay, on an arm of the sea, with a pretty
      paved walk, or terrace, before the house, which seems used as a mall by
      the inhabitants, and is stored with naval offices innumerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies received us very pleasantly. Mrs. La Forey Is well bred, in
      the formal way; but her eldest daughter, Mrs. Molloy, is quite free from
      stiffness, yet perfectly obliging, very easy, very modest, and very
      engaging, and, when dressed for a ball in the evening, very handsome. She
      does not become a déshabille, but cannot look otherwise than pleasing and
      agreeable, from her manners and countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Molloy, her husband, was gone to attend in the naval procession
      that conducted the royals to Mount-Edgecumbe, where he expected to dine;
      but he had left a younger officer, Lieutenant Gregory, to do the honours
      of the naval show to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner himself is yet more formal than his lady, but equally
      civil. An unmarried daughter appeared next, who seems sensible and good
      humoured, but very plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sallied forth to the dockyard, with these two daughters, and Lieutenant
      Gregory, a very pleasing and well-bred young officer. How often I wished
      my dear James had happened to be here, in any employment, at this time!
    </p>
    <p>
      The dockyard you will dispense with my describing. It is a noble and
      tremendous sight, and we were shown it with every advantage of
      explanation. It was a sort of sighing satisfaction to see such numerous
      stores of war&rsquo;s alarms!-ropes, sails, masts, anchors,&mdash;and all
      in the finest symmetry, divided and subdivided, as if placed only for
      show, The neatness and exactness of all the arrangement of those stores
      for tempest, filled me with admiration; so did the whole scene&mdash;though
      not with pleasure. All assurances, however well to be depended upon, of
      safety, are but so many indications of danger.<span class="pagenum">325</span><a
      name="link325" id="link325"></a> While we were seeing the anchor business,&mdash;which
      seemed performed by Vulcanic demons, so black they looked, so savage was
      their howl in striking the red-hot iron, and so coarse and slight their
      attire,&mdash;we were saluted with three cheers, from the accidental
      entrance of Lord Stopford, Lord Courtown&rsquo;s son, and Mr. Townshend,
      his nephew, a son of Lord Sydney, just made a lord of the Admiralty. And
      the sound, in those black regions, where all the light was red-hot fire,
      had a Very fine demoniac effect. In beating the anchor they all strike at
      the same instant, giving about three quick strokes to one slow stroke; and
      were they not to time them with the most perfect conformity, they must
      inevitably knock out one another&rsquo;s brains. The sight of this
      apparently continual danger gave to the whole the appearance of some wild
      rite performed from motives of superstition in some uncivilised country.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we were yet in the dockyard we were joined by two sea-captains,
      Captain Molloy and Captain Duckworth. Captain Molloy is a sensible and
      agreeable man, but somewhat haughty, and of conscious consequence. Captain
      Duckworth is both sensible and amiable in his style of conversation, and
      has a most perfect and kind openness of manner and countenance; but he
      greatly amused me by letting me see how much I amused him. I never
      surprised him looking near me, without seeing on his face so irresistible
      a simper, that I expected him every moment to break forth; never even
      trying to keep a grave face, except when I looked at him in full front. I
      found he knew &ldquo;Burney, of the Bristol,&rdquo; as he called our
      James, and I named and conversed about him by every opportunity.

    <h2>
      A VISIT TO A SEVENTY-FOUR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Captain Molloy invited us, when we had exhausted the show on land, to see
      his ship. I dislike going anywhere beyond the reach of the Humane society,
      but could not be left without breaking up the party: this was my first
      water-excursion, though two had been proposed to me at Weymouth, which I
      had begged leave to decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      All, however, was smooth and calm, and we had the best possible
      navigators. We went to the ship in Captain Molloy&rsquo;s large boat,
      which was very trim and neat, and had all its rowers new dressed and smart
      for royal attendance, as it followed the king in all his water-excursions.
      <span class="pagenum">326</span><a name="link326" id="link326"></a> The
      Ship is the Bombay Castle, of seventy-four guns. It had the Admiralty flag
      hoisted, as Lord Chatham had held a board there in the morning. It is a
      very fine ship, and I was truly edified by the sight of all its
      accommodations, ingenuity, utility, cleanliness, and contrivances. A
      man-of-war, fitted out and manned, is a glorious and a fearful sight!
    </p>
    <p>
      In going over the ship we came to the midshipmen&rsquo;s mess, and those
      young officers were at dinner, but we were taken in: they were lighted by
      a few candles fastened to the wall in sockets. Involuntarily I exclaimed,
      &ldquo;Dining by candle-light at noon-day!&rdquo; A midshipman, starting
      forward, said, &ldquo;Yes&rsquo;, ma&rsquo;am, and Admiral Lord Hood did
      the same for seven years following!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I liked his spirit so much that I turned to him, and said I was very glad
      they looked forward to such an example, for I had a brother in the
      service, which gave me a warm interest in its prosperity. This made the
      midshipman so much my friend, that we entered into a detailed discourse
      upon the accommodations of their cabin, mess, etc., and various other
      matters. I liked him much, though I know not his name; but my constant
      Captain Duckworth kept me again wholly to his own cicerone-ing, when I
      turned out of the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little, however, he was mortified to find me a coward upon the water. I
      assured him he should cure me if he could convince me there was no reason
      for fear. He would not allow of any, but could not disprove it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and honestly,&mdash;should we be
      overturned in the boat while out at sea, what would prevent our being
      drowned?&rdquo; He would not suppose such an accident possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pressed him, however, upon the possibility it might happen once in a
      century, and he could not help laughing, and answered, &ldquo;O, we should
      pick you all up!&rdquo;&mdash;I desired to know by what means. &ldquo;Instruments,&rdquo;
      he said. I forced him, after a long and comic resistance, to show me them.
      Good heaven! they were three-pronged iron forks,&mdash;very tridents of
      Neptune!
    </p>
    <p>
      I exclaimed with great horror, &ldquo;These!&mdash;why, they would tear
      the body to pieces!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O,&rdquo; answered he calmly, &ldquo;one must not think of legs and
      arms when life is in danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I would not, however, under such protection, refuse sailing round
      Mount-Edgecumbe, which we did in Captain Molloy&rsquo;s boat, and just at
      the time when the royals, in sundry garden-<span class="pagenum">327</span><a
      name="link327" id="link327"></a> chairs, were driving about the place. It
      was a beautiful view the situation is delightful. But Captain Molloy was
      not in the best harmony with its owners, as they had disappointed his
      expectations of an Invitation to dinner.

    <h2>
      A DAY AT MOUNT-EDGECUMBE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aug. 24.&mdash;To-day the royals went to Marystow, Colonel Heywood&rsquo;s,
      and Miss Planta and myself to Mount-Edgecumbe. The queen had desired me to
      take Miss Planta, and I had written to prepare Lady Mount-Edgecumbe for a
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went in a chaise to the ferry, and thence in a boat. I did not like
      this part of the business, for we had no pilot we knew, nor any one to
      direct us. They would hardly believe, at Mount-Edgecumbe, we had
      adventured in so unguarded a manner: but our superior is too high to
      discover difficulties, or know common precautions; and we fare, therefore,
      considerably worse in all these excursions, from belonging to crowned
      heads, than we should do in our own private stations, if visiting at any
      part of the kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safe, however, though not pleasantly, we arrived on the opposite shore;
      when we found a gardener and a very commodious garden-chair waiting for
      us. We drove through a sweet park to the house, at the gate of which stood
      Lord and Lady Mount-Edgecumbe, who told us that they had just heard an
      intention of their majesties to sail the next day up the River Tamer, and
      therefore they thought it their duty to hasten off to a seat they have
      near its banks, Coteil, with refreshments and accommodations, in case they
      should be honoured with a visit to see the place, which was very ancient
      and curious. They should leave Lord Valletort to do the honours, and
      expressed much civil regret in the circumstance: but the distance was too
      great to admit of the journey, over bad roads, if they deferred it till
      after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then proceeded, in the chair, to see the place: it is truly noble; but
      I shall enter into no description from want of time: take a list simply of
      its particular points. The sea, in some places, shows itself in its whole
      vast and unlimited expanse; at others, the jutting land renders it merely
      a beautiful basin or canal: the borders down to the sea are in some parts
      flourishing with the finest evergreens and most vivid verdure, and in
      others are barren, rocky, and perilous. In one moment you might suppose
      yourself cast on a desert island, <span class="pagenum">328</span><a
      name="link328" id="link328"></a> and the next find yourself in the most
      fertile and luxurious country. In different views we were shown Cawsand
      bay, the Hamoaze, the rocks called &ldquo;the Maker,&rdquo; etc.,&mdash;Dartmoor
      hills, Plymouth, the dockyard, Saltram, and St. George&rsquo;s channel.
      Several noble ships, manned and commissioned-were in the Hamoaze amongst
      them our Weymouth friends&rsquo; the Magnificent and Southampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very beautiful flower-garden is enclosed in one part of the grounds; and
      huts, seats, and ornaments in general, were well adapted to the scenery of
      the place. A seat is consecrated to Mrs. Damer,<a href="#linknote-316"
      name="linknoteref-316" id="linknoteref-316"><small>316</small></a> with an
      acrostic on her name by Lord Valletort. It is surprising to see the state
      of vegetation at this place, so close to the main. Myrtles, pomegranates,
      evergreens, and flowering shrubs, all thrive, and stand the cold blast,
      when planted in a southern aspect, as safely as in an inland country. As
      it is a peninsula, it has all aspects, and the plantations and
      dispositions of the ground are admirably and skilfully assorted to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great open view, however, disappointed me: the towns it shows have no
      prominent features, the country is as flat as it is extensive, and the
      various branches of the sea which run into it give, upon their retreat, a
      marshy, muddy, unpleasant appearance. There is, besides, a want of some
      one striking object to arrest the eye, and fix the attention, which
      wearies from the general glare. Points, however, there are, both of the
      sublime and beautiful, that merit all the fame which this noble place has
      acquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our tour around it we met Lord Stopford, Mr. Townshend, and Captain
      Douglas; and heard a tremendous account of the rage of the sea-captains,
      on being disappointed of a dinner at the royal visit to Mount-Edgecumbe.
    </p>
    <p>
      We did not quit these fine grounds till near dinner-time. The housekeeper
      then showed us the house, and a set of apartments newly fitted up for the
      royals, had they chosen to sleep at Mount-Edgecumbe. The house is old, and
      seems pleasant and convenient.<span class="pagenum">329</span><a
      name="link329" id="link329"></a> In a very pretty circular parlour, which
      had the appearance of being the chief living room, I saw amongst a small
      collection of books, &ldquo;Cecilia.&rdquo; I immediately laid a wager
      with myself the first volume would open upon Pacchierotti; and I won it
      very honestly, though I never expect to be paid it. The chapter, &ldquo;An
      Opera Rehearsal,&rdquo; was so well read, the leaves always flew apart to
      display it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The library is an exceeding good room, and seems charmingly furnished.
      Here Lord Valletort received us. His lady was confined to her room by
      indisposition. He is a most neat little beau, and his face has the roses
      and lilies as finely blended as that of his pretty young wife. He was
      extremely civil and attentive, and appears to be really amiable in his
      disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brett, a plain, sensible, conversible man, who has an estate in the
      neighbourhood, dined with us; and a young Frenchman. The dinner was very
      cheerful: my lord, at the head of the table, looked only like his lady in
      a riding-dress. However, he received one mortifying trial of his temper he
      had sent to request sailing up the Tamer next day with Sir Richard
      Bickerton; and he had a blunt refusal, in a note, during our repast. Not
      an officer in the fleet would accommodate him; their resentment of the
      dinner slight is quite vehement.
    </p>
    <p>
      We returned home the same way we came; the good-natured little lord, and
      Mr. Brett also, quite shocked we had no better guard or care taken of us.

    <h2>
      MR. FAIRLY ON A COURT LIFE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Weymouth, Sunday, Sept. 6.&mdash;This evening, the royals and their train
      all went again to the rooms to drink their tea. Miss Planta and myself
      were taking ours quietly together, and I was finishing a charming sermon
      of Blair while she was running over some old newspapers, when, suddenly,
      but very gently, the room-door was opened, and then I heard, &ldquo;Will
      Miss Burney permit me to come in, and give me a dish of tea?&rdquo;
      &lsquo;Twas Mr. Fairly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said we were to go on Monday se&rsquo;nnight to Lord Bath&rsquo;s, on
      Wednesday to Lord Aylesbury&rsquo;s, and on Friday to return to Windsor.
      He was himself to be discharged some days sooner, as he should not be
      wanted on the road. He said many things relative to Court lives and
      situations: with respect, deference, and regard invariable, mentioned the
      leading individuals; but said nothing could be so weak as to <span
      class="pagenum">330</span><a name="link330" id="link330"></a> look there,
      in such stations, for such impossibilities as sympathy, friendship, or
      cordiality! And he finished with saying, &ldquo;People forget themselves
      who look for them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, however, is not my feeling; and I am satisfied he has met with some
      unexpected coldness. Miss Planta being present, he explained only in
      generals.

    <h2>
      A BRIEF SOJOURN AT LONGLEAT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Monday, Sept. 14.&mdash;We all left Weymouth. All possible honours were
      paid the king on his departure; lords, ladies, and sea-officers, lined the
      way that he passed, the guns of the Magnificent and Southampton fired the
      parting salute, and the ships were under sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all set out as before, but parted on the road. The royals went to
      breakfast at Redlinch, the seat of Lord Ilchester, where Mr. Fairly<a
      href="#linknote-317" name="linknoteref-317" id="linknoteref-317"><small>317</small></a>
      was in waiting for them, and thence proceeded to a collation at Sherborne
      Castle, whither he was to accompany them, and then resign his present
      attendance, which has been long and troublesome and irksome, I am sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta and myself proceeded to Longleat, the seat of the Marquis of
      Bath, late Lord Weymouth; where we were all to dine, sleep, and spend the
      following day and night. Longleat was formerly the dwelling of the Earl of
      Lansdowne, uncle to Mrs. Delany; and here, at this seat, that heartless
      uncle, to promote some political views, sacrificed his incomparable niece,
      at the age of seventeen, marrying her to an unwieldly, uncultivated,
      country esquire, near sixty years of age, and scarce ever sober&mdash;his
      name Pendarves.
    </p>
    <p>
      With how sad an awe, in recollecting her submissive unhappiness, did I
      enter these doors!&mdash;and with what indignant hatred did I look at the
      portrait of the unfeeling earl, to whom her gentle repugnance, shown by
      almost incessant tears, was thrown away, as if she, her person, and her
      existence were nothing in the scale, where the disposition of a few
      boroughs opposed them! Yet was this the famous Granville&mdash;the poet,
      the fine gentleman, the statesman, the friend and patron of Pope, of whom
      he wrote&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Muse for Granville can refuse to sing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mine, I am sure, for one.<span class="pagenum">331</span><a name="link331"
      id="link331"></a> Lady Bath showed us our rooms, to which we repaired
      immediately, to dress before the arrival of the royals.
    </p>
    <p>
      We dined with the gentlemen, all but the marquis, who was admitted, in his
      own house, to dine with the king and queen, as were all the ladies of his
      family. Lord Weymouth, the eldest son, was our president; and two of his
      brothers, Lords George and John, with Lord Courtown and the two colonels,
      made the party. The Weymouths, Thynnes rather, are silent, and we had but
      little talk or entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house is very magnificent, and of in immense magnitude. It seems much
      out of repair, and by no means cheerful or comfortable. Gloomy grandeur
      seems the proper epithet for the building and its fitting-up. It had been
      designed for a monastery, and as such was nearly completed when Henry
      VIII. dissolved those seminaries. It was finished as a dwelling-house in
      the reign of his son, by one of the Thynnes, who was knighted in a field
      of battle by the protector Somerset.<a href="#linknote-318"
      name="linknoteref-318" id="linknoteref-318"><small>318</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Many things in the house, and many queer old portraits, afforded me matter
      of Speculation, and would have filled up more time than I had to bestow.
      There are portraits of Jane Shore and Fair Rosamond, which have some marks
      of originality, being miserable daubs, yet from evidently beautiful
      subjects. Arabella Stuart is also at full length, and King Charleses and
      Jameses in abundance, with their queens, brethren, and cousins. There are
      galleries in this house of the dimensions of college halls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state rooms on the ground floor are very handsome but the queer
      antique little old corners, cells, recesses, &ldquo;passages that lead to
      nothing,&rdquo; unexpected openings, and abrupt stoppages, with the quaint
      devices of various old-fashioned ornaments, amused me the most. <span
      class="pagenum">332</span><a name="link332" id="link332"></a> My bed-room
      was furnished with crimson velvet, bed included, yet so high, though only
      the second story, that it made me giddy to look into the park, and tired
      to wind up the flight of stairs. It was formerly the favourite room, the
      housekeeper told me, of Bishop Ken, who put on his shroud in it before he
      died. Had I fancied I had seen his ghost, I might have screamed my voice
      away, unheard by any assistant to lay it; for so far was I from the rest
      of the habitable part of the mansion, that not the lungs of Mr. Bruce
      could have availed me.<a href="#linknote-319" name="linknoteref-319"
      id="linknoteref-319"><small>319</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The park is noble and spacious. It was filled with country folks,
      permitted to enter that they might see their sovereigns, and it looked as
      gay without as it seemed gloomy within. The people were dressed in their
      best, as if they came to a fair; and such shouts and hallooings ensued,
      whenever the king appeared at a window, that the whole building rang again
      with the vibration. Nothing upon earth can be more gratifying than the
      sight of this dear and excellent king thus loved and received by all
      descriptions of his subjects.

    <h2>
      TOTTENHAM COURT: RETURN TO WINDSOR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sept. 16.&mdash;We set out, amidst the acclamations of a multitude, from
      Longleat for Tottenham park, the seat of Lord Aylesbury. The park is of
      great extent and moderate beauty. The house is very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had only our own party, the three gentlemen, at dinner and breakfast.
      These gentlemen only dine with the king when he keeps house, and keeps it
      incog. himself. At Tottenham park, only my Lord Aylesbury, as master of
      the house, was admitted. He and his lady were both extremely desirous to
      make all their guests comfortable; and Lady Aylesbury very politely
      offered me the use of her own collection of books. But I found, at the top
      of the house, a very large old library, in which there were sundry
      uncommon and curious old English tracts, that afforded me much
      entertainment. &lsquo;Tis a library of long standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are many original portraits also, that offer enough for speculation.
      A &ldquo;Bloody Mary,&rdquo; by Sir Anthony More, which I saw with much
      curiosity, and liked better than I expected. The beautiful Duchesses of
      Cleveland and Portsmouth, I fancy<span class="pagenum">333</span><a
      name="link333" id="link333"></a> by Kneller; but we had no cicerone. A
      very fine picture of a lady in black, that I can credit to be Vandyke, but
      who else can I know not. Several portraits by Sir Peter Lely, extremely
      soft and pleasing, and of subjects uncommonly beautiful; many by Sir
      Godfrey Kneller, well enough; and many more by Sir Something Thornhill,<a
      href="#linknote-320" name="linknoteref-320" id="linknoteref-320"><small>320</small></a>
      very thick and heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good lord of the mansion put up a new bed for the king and queen that
      cost him nine hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two things I heard here with concern-that my godmother, Mrs. Greville, was
      dead; and that poor Sir Joshua Reynolds had lost the sight of one of his
      eyes.<a href="#linknote-321" name="linknoteref-321" id="linknoteref-321"><small>321</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sept. 18.&mdash;We left Tottenham Court, and returned to Windsor. The
      royals hastened to the younger princesses, and I to Mrs. Schwellenberg. I
      was civilly received, however. But deadly dead sunk my heart as I entered
      her apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I had a visit from my dear brother Charles full of business,
      letters, etc. I rejoiced to see him, and to confab over all his affairs,
      plans, and visions, more at full length than for a long time past. I was
      forced to introduce him to Mrs. Schwellenberg, and he flourished away
      successfully enough; but it was very vexatious, as he had matters
      innumerable for discussion. <span class="pagenum">334</span><a

    <h2>
      RUMOURS OF MR. FAIRLY&rsquo;S IMPENDING MARRIAGE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Colonel Gwynn told us, at tea-time, of the wonderful recovery of Colonel
      Goldsworthy, who has had an almost desperate illness; and then added that
      he had dined the preceding day with him, and met Mr. Fairly, who was
      coming to Windsor, and all prepared, when he was suddenly stopped, on the
      very preceding evening, by a fresh attack of the gout.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard this with much concern, and made many inquiries, which were
      presently interrupted by an exclamation of Major Garth, who was now in
      waiting: &ldquo;The gout?&rdquo; he cried: &ldquo;nay, then, it is time he
      should get a nurse; and, indeed, I hear he has one in view.&rdquo; Colonel
      Gwynn instantly turned short, with a very significant smile of triumph,
      towards me, that seemed to confirm this assertion, while it exulted in his
      own prediction at Cheltenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following morning, while I was alone with my royal mistress, she
      mentioned Mr. Fairly for the first time since we left Weymouth. It was to
      express much displeasure against him: e had misled Lord Aylesbury about
      the ensuing Drawing-room, by affirming there would be none this month.
      After saying how wrong this was, and hearing me venture to answer I could
      not doubt but he must have had some reason, which, if known, might account
      for his mistake, she suddenly, and with some severity of accent, said,
      &ldquo;He will not come<span class="pagenum">335</span><a name="link335"
      id="link335"></a> here! For some reason or other he does not choose it! He
      cannot bear to come!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How was I amazed! and silenced pretty effectually
    </p>
    <p>
      She then added, &ldquo;He has set his head against coming. I know he has
      been in town some considerable time, but he has desired it may not be told
      here. I know, too, that when he has been met in the streets, he has called
      out, &lsquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, if you are going to Windsor, do not
      say you have seen me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov. 18.&mdash;We were to go to town: but while I was taking my hasty
      breakfast Miss Planta flew into the room, eagerly exclaiming, &ldquo;Have
      you heard the news?&rdquo; I saw, instantly, by her eyes and manner, what
      she meant and therefore answered, &ldquo;I believe so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fairly is going to be married! I resolved I would tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard the rumour,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;the other day, from
      Colonel Gwynn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, it&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;he has written to ask
      leave; but for heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave her my ready promise, for I believed not a syllable of the matter;
      but I would not tell her that.

    <h2>
      A ROYAL VISIT TO THE THEATRE: JAMMED IN THE CROWD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We went to town not only for the Drawing-room on the next day, but also
      for the play on this Wednesday night,<a href="#linknote-322"
      name="linknoteref-322" id="linknoteref-322"><small>322</small></a> and the
      party appointed to sit in the queen&rsquo;s private box, as, on these
      occasions, the balcony-box opposite to the royals is called, dined with
      Mrs. Schwellenberg,&mdash;namely, Mrs. Stainforth, Miss Planta, Mr. de
      Luc, and Mr. Thomas Willis.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we arrived at the playhouse<a href="#linknote-323"
      name="linknoteref-323" id="linknoteref-323"><small>323</small></a> we
      found the lobby and all the avenues so crowded, that it was with the
      utmost difficulty we forced our way up the stairs. It was the first
      appearance of the good king at the theatre since his illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got up stairs, we were stopped effectually: there was not room for
      a fly; and though our box was not only taken and kept, but partitioned
      off, to get to it was wholly impracticable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Willis and Miss Planta protested they would go down<span
      class="pagenum">336</span><a name="link336" id="link336"></a> again, and
      remonstrate with Mr. Harris, the manager; and I must own the scene that
      followed was not unentertaining. Mrs. Stainforth and myself were fast
      fixed in an angle at the corner of the stairs, and Mr. de Luc stood in the
      midst of the crowd, where he began offering so many grave arguments, with
      such deliberation and precision, every now and then going back in his
      reasoning to correct his own English, representing our right to proceed,
      and the wrong of not making way for us, that it was irresistibly comic to
      see the people stare, as they pushed On, and to see his unconscious
      content in their passing him, so long as he completed his expostulations
      on their indecorum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, poor Mrs. Stainforth lost her cloak, and in her loud
      lamentations, and calls upon all present to witness her distress (to
      which, for enhancing its importance, she continually added, &ldquo;Whoever
      has found it should bring it to the Queen&rsquo;s house&rdquo;), she
      occupied the attention of all upon the stairs as completely as it was
      occupied by Mr. de Luc for all in &lsquo;the passages: but, alas! neither
      the philosophic harangue of the one, nor the royal dignity of the other,
      prevailed; and while there we stood, expecting an avenue to be formed,
      either for our eloquence or our consequence, not an inch of ground did we
      gain, and those who had neither made their way, and got on in multitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Offended, at length, as well as tired, Mrs. Stainforth proposed our going
      down, and waiting in the lobby, till Mr. Harris arrived. Here we were
      joined by a gentleman, whose manner of fixing me showed a
      half-recollection of my face, which I precisely returned him, without
      being able to recollect where I had seen him before. He spoke to Mrs.
      Stainforth, who answered as if she knew him, and then he came to me and
      offered to assist in getting me to my box. I told him the manager had
      already been sent to. He did not, however, go off, but entered into
      conversation upon the crowd, play, etc., with the ease of an old
      acquaintance. I took the first opportunity to inquire of Mrs. Stainforth
      who he was, and heard&mdash;Lord Mountmorres, whom you may remember I met
      with at the theatre at Cheltenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, however, was ridiculous though was, that, after a considerable
      length of time, he asked me who Mrs. Stainforth was, and I afterwards
      heard he had made the same inquiry of herself about me! The difference of
      a dressed and undressed head had occasioned, I suppose, the doubt. The
      moment, <span class="pagenum">337</span><a name="link337" id="link337"></a>
      however, he had completely satisfied himself in this, he fairly joined me,
      as if he had naturally belonged to our party. And it turned out very
      acceptable, for we were involved in all such sort of difficulties as our
      philosopher was the least adapted to remove.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now went about, in and out, up and down, but without any power to make
      way, the crowd every instant thickening. We then were fain to return to
      our quiet post, behind the side-boxes in the lobby, where we remained till
      the arrival of the king, and then were somewhat recompensed for missing
      the sight of his entrance, by hearing the sound of his reception: for so
      violent an huzzaing commenced, such thundering clapping, knocking with
      sticks, and shouting, and so universal a chorus of &ldquo;God save the
      king,&rdquo; that not all the inconveniences of my situation could keep my
      heart from beating with joy, nor my eyes from running over with gratitude
      for its occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountmorres, who joined in the stick part of the general plaudit,
      exclaimed frequently, &ldquo;What popularity is this! how fine to a man&rsquo;s
      feelings! yet he Must find it embarrassing.&rdquo; Indeed I should suppose
      he could with difficulty bear it, &lsquo;Twas almost adoration! How much I
      lament that I lost the sight of his benign countenance, during such
      glorious moments as the most favoured monarchs can scarce enjoy twice in
      the longest life!
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Planta and Mr. Willis now returned: they had had no success; Mr.
      Harris said they might as well stem the tide of the ocean as oppose or
      rule such a crowd. The play now began; and Lord Mountmorres went away to
      reconnoitre, but, presently returning, said, &ldquo;If you will trust
      yourselves with me I will show you your chance.&rdquo; And then he
      conducted me to the foot of the stairs leading to our box, which exhibited
      such a mass of living creatures, that the insects of an ant-hill could
      scarce be more compact.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were passed by Lord Stopford, Captain Douglas, and some other of our
      acquaintance, who told us of similar distresses; and in this manner passed
      the first act! The boxkeeper came and told Lord Mountmorres he could now
      give his lordship one seat: but the humours of the lobby he now preferred,
      and refused the place: though I repeatedly begged that we might not detain
      him. But he was determined to see us safe landed before he left us. <span
      class="pagenum">338</span><a name="link338" id="link338"></a> Mr. Harris
      now came again, and proposed taking us another way, to try to get up some
      back-stairs. We then went behind the scenes for this purpose: but here Mr.
      Harris was called away, and we were left upon the stage. Lord Mountmorres
      led me to various peep-holes, where I could at least have the satisfaction
      of seeing the king and royal family, as well as the people, and the whole
      was a sight most grateful to my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      So civil, however, and so attentive he was, that a new perplexity now
      occurred to me: he had given up his place, and had taken so much trouble,
      that I thought, if we at last got to our box, he would certainly expect to
      be accommodated in it. And to take any one, without previous permission,
      into the queen&rsquo;s private box, and immediately facing their
      majesties, was a liberty I knew not how to risk; and, in truth, I knew not
      enough of his present politics to be at all sure if they might not be even
      peculiarly obnoxious. This consideration, therefore, began now so much to
      reconcile me to this emigrant evening, that I ceased even to wish for
      recovering our box.

    <h2>
      IN THE MANAGER&rsquo;S BOX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Mr. Harris came back, he said he had nothing to propose but his own
      box, which was readily accepted. To this our access was easy, as it was
      over the king and queen, and consequently not desirable to those who came
      to see them. I too now preferred it, as it was out of their sight, and
      enabled me to tell Lord Mountmorres, who led me to it through the crowd
      with unceasing trouble and attention, that till he could get better
      accommodated a place was at his service.
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed instantly with the offer, placing himself behind me; but said he
      saw some of his relations in the opposite stage-box, Lady Mornington and
      her beautiful daughter Lady Ann Wellesley, and, as soon as the act was
      over, he would go down and persuade them to make room for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was shocked, however, after all this, to hear him own himself glad to
      sit down, as he was still rather lame, from a dreadful overturn in a
      carriage, in which his leg had been nearly crushed by being caught within
      the coach-door, which beat down upon it, and almost demolished it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This anecdote, however, led to another more pleasant; for it brought on a
      conversation which showed me his present principles, at least, were all on
      the government side. The accident had happened during a Journey to
      Chester, in his way to <span class="pagenum">339</span><a name="link339"
      id="link339"></a> Ireland, whither he was hastening upon the Regency
      business, last winter: and he went to the Irish House of Peers the first
      time he quitted his room, after a confinement of three weeks from this
      terrible bruise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;could you stand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not stand,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;they indulged me with
      leave to speak sitting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a useful opening, then, my lord,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;did
      you lose for every new paragraph!&rdquo; I meant, the cant of &ldquo;Now I
      am upon my legs.&rdquo; He understood it instantly, and laughed heartily,
      protesting it was no small detriment to his oratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play was the &ldquo;Dramatist,"<a href="#linknote-324"
      name="linknoteref-324" id="linknoteref-324"><small>324</small></a> written
      with that species of humour in caricature that resembles O&rsquo;Keefe&rsquo;s
      performances; full of absurdities, yet laughable in the extreme. We heard
      very ill, and, missing the beginning, we understood still worse: so that,
      in fact, I was indebted to my new associate for all the entertainment I
      received the whole evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the act was over, the place on which he had cast his eye, near Lady
      Mornington, was seized; he laughed, put down his hat, and composed himself
      quietly for remaining where he was. He must be a man of a singular
      character, though of what sort I know not: but in his conversation he
      showed much information, and a spirited desire of interchanging ideas with
      those who came in his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      We talked a great deal of France, and he related to me a variety of
      anecdotes just fresh imported thence. He was there at the first assembling
      of the Notables, and he saw, he said impending great events from that
      assemblage. The two most remarkable things that had struck him, he told
      me, in this wonderful revolution, were&mdash;first, that the French guards
      should ever give up their king; and secondly, that the chief spirit and
      capacity hither-to shown amongst individuals had come from the
      ecclesiastics.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is very much of the opinion the spirit of the times will come round to
      this island. In what, I asked, could be its pretence?&mdash;The game-laws,
      he answered, and the tithes. He told me, also, a great deal of Ireland,
      and enlarged my political knowledge abundantly,&mdash;but I shall not be
      so generous, my dear friends, as to let you into all these state matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I must tell you a good sort of quirk of Mr. Wilkes, who, when the
      power of the mob and their cruelty were first reciting,<span
      class="pagenum">340</span><a name="link340" id="link340"></a> quarrelled
      with a gentleman for saying the French government was become a democracy
      and asserted it was rather a mobocracy. The pit, he said, reminded him of
      a sight he once saw in Westminster Hall,&mdash;a floor of faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a candidate for Westminster at that time, with Charles Fox!&mdash;thus
      do we veer about.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the farce, &ldquo;God save the king&rdquo; was most
      vociferously called for from all parts of the theatre, and all the singers
      of the theatre came on the stage to sing it, joined by the whole audience,
      who kept it up till the sovereign of his people&rsquo;s hearts left the
      house. It was noble and heart-melting at once to hear and see such loyal
      rapture, and to feel and know it so deserved.

    <h2>
      MR. FAIRLY&rsquo;S MARRIAGE IMMINENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      NOV. 20.&mdash;Some business sent me to speak with Miss Planta before our
      journey back to Windsor. When it was executed and I was coming away, she
      called out, &ldquo;O! apropos&mdash;it&rsquo;s all declared, and the
      princesses wished Miss Fuzilier joy yesterday in the Drawing-room. She
      looked remarkably well; but said Mr. Fairly had still a little gout, and
      could not appear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now first my belief followed assertion;&mdash;but it was only because it
      was inevitable, since the princesses could not have proceeded so far
      without certainty......
    </p>
    <p>
      We returned to Windsor as usual, and there I was, just as usual, obliged
      to finish every evening with picquet!&mdash;and to pass all and every
      afternoon, from dinner to midnight, in picquet company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nov. 28.&mdash;The queen, after a very long airing, came in to dress, and
      summoned me immediately; and in two minutes the princess royal entered,
      and said something in German, and then added, &ldquo;And Mr. Fairly, ma&rsquo;am,
      begs he may see you a moment, now, if possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This is his first coming to the house since her royal highness&rsquo;s
      birthday, just two months ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; was answered coolly, &ldquo;but I am going
      to dress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t keep you a moment, mamma, only he wants to get on to
      St. Leonards to dinner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Fuzilier is now there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll slip on my
      powdering-gown, and see him.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">341</span><a
      name="link341" id="link341"></a> I found, however, they had already met,
      probably in the passage, for the queen added, &ldquo;How melancholy he
      looks, does not he, princess royal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, mamma!&rdquo;&mdash;They then again talked German.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess then went to call him; and I hastened into the next room,
      with some caps just then inspecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Turbulent again dined with us, and said, &ldquo;I find Mr. Fairly is
      here to-day? when is he to be married?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schwellenberg reproved him for talking of &ldquo;soch things:&rdquo;
      she holds it petty treason to speak of it, as they are both in office
      about the Court; though she confessed it would be in a fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      At tea, when the gentlemen&mdash;General Budé, Majors Price and Garth, and
      Mr. Willis&mdash;appeared, she said, &ldquo;Where be Mr. Fairly?&rdquo;
      They all exclaimed, &ldquo;Is he here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, certain, if he ben&rsquo;t gone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I then said he had gone on to St. Leonards.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all expressed the utmost surprise that he should come, and go, and
      see none of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they retired, Mrs. Schwellenberg exclaimed, &ldquo;For what not stay
      one night? For what not go to the gentlemen? It looks like when he been
      ashamed.&mdash;O fie! I don&rsquo;t not like soch ting. And for what
      always say contrarie?&mdash;always say to everybody he won&rsquo;t not
      have her!&mdash;There might be something wrong in all that&mdash;it looks
      not well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw a strong desire to have me enter into the merits of the case; but I
      constantly answer to these exclamations, that these sort of situations are
      regarded in the world as licensing denials first, and truancy from all
      others afterwards.

      COURT DUTIES DISCUSSED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      December.-Let me now, to enliven you a little, introduce to you a new
      acquaintance, self-made, that I meet at the chapel, and who always sits
      next me when there is room,&mdash;Mrs. J&mdash;&mdash;-, wife to the
      Bishop of K&mdash;: and before the service begins, she enters into small
      talk, with a pretty tolerable degree of frankness, not much repressed by
      scruples of delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a specimen. She opened, the other morning, upon my situation and
      occupation, and made the most plump inquiries into its particulars, with a
      sort of hearty good humour<span class="pagenum">342</span><a name="link342"
      id="link342"></a> that removed all impertinence, whatever it left of
      inelegance and then began her comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; the queen, to be sure, is a great deal better dressed than
      she used to be; but for all that, I really think it is but an odd thing
      for you!&mdash;Dear! I think it&rsquo;s something so out of the way for
      you!&mdash;I can&rsquo;t think how you set about it. It must have been
      very droll to you at first. A great deal of honour, to be sure, to serve a
      queen, and all that: but I dare say a lady&rsquo;s-maid could do it
      better,&mdash;though to be called about a queen, as I say, is a great deal
      of honour: but, for my part, I should not like it; because to be always
      obliged to go to a person, whether one was in the humour or not, and to
      get up in a morning, if one was never so sleepy!&mdash;dear! it must be a
      mighty hurry-skurry life! you don&rsquo;t look at all fit for it, to judge
      by appearances, for all its great honour, and all that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Is not this a fit bishop&rsquo;s wife? is not here primitive candour and
      veracity? I laughed most heartily,&mdash;and we have now commenced
      acquaintance for these occasional meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this honest dame does not think me fit for this part of my business,
      there is another person, Mlle. Montmoulin, who, with equal simplicity,
      expresses her idea of my unfitness for another part.&mdash;&ldquo;How you
      bear it,&rdquo; she cries, &ldquo;living with Mrs. Schwellenberg!&mdash;I
      like it better living in prison!&mdash;&lsquo;pon m&rsquo;honneur, I
      prefer it bread and water; I think her so cross never was. If I you, I won&rsquo;t
      bear it&mdash;poor Miss Burney!&mdash;I so sorry!&mdash;&lsquo;pon m&rsquo;honneur,
      I think to you oftens!&mdash;you so confined, you won&rsquo;t have no
      pleasures!&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Gomme, less plaintive, but more solemn, declared the other day,
      &ldquo;I am sure you must go to heaven for living this life!&rdquo;&mdash;-So,

    <h2>
      MR. FAIRLY&rsquo;S STRANGE WEDDING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      January, 1790.&mdash;Mr. Fairly was married the 6th&mdash;I must wish
      happiness to smile on that day, and all its anniversaries, it gave a
      happiness to me unequalled, for it was the birthday of my Susanna!
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, about this time, Mr. Fisher, now Doctor, drank tea with us at
      Windsor, and gave me an account of Mr. Fairly&rsquo;s marriage that much
      amazed me. He had been called upon to perform the ceremony. It was by
      special licence, and at the house of Sir R&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.<a
      href="#linknote-325" name="linknoteref-325" id="linknoteref-325"><small>325</small></a>
      <span class="pagenum">343</span><a name="link343" id="link343"></a> So
      religious, so strict in all ceremonies, even, of religion, as he always
      appeared, his marrying out of a church was to me very unexpected. Dr.
      Fisher was himself surprised, when called upon, and said he supposed it
      must be to please the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing, he owned, could be less formal or solemn than the whole. Lady C.,
      Mrs. and Miss S., and her father and brother and sister, were present.
      They all dined together at the usual hour,'and then the ladies, as usual,
      retired. Some time after, the clerk was sent for, and then, with the
      gentlemen, joined the ladies, who were in the drawing-room, seated on
      sofas, just as at any other time, Dr. Fisher says he is not sure they were
      working, but the air of common employment was such, that he rather thinks
      it, and everything of that sort was spread about as on any common day&mdash;workboxes,
      netting-cases, etc. Mr. Fairly then asked Dr. Fisher what they were to do?
      He answered, he could not tell; for he had never married anybody in a room
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, they agreed to move a table to the upper end of the room, the
      ladies still sitting quietly, and then Put on it candles and a
      prayer-book. Dr. Fisher says he hopes it was not a card-table, and rather
      believes it was only a Pembroke work-table. The lady and Sir R. then came
      forward, and Dr. Fisher read the service.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this, methinks, seems the way to make all things easy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet&mdash;with so little solemnity-without even a room prepared and empty&mdash;to
      go through a business of such portentous seriousness!&mdash;&lsquo;Tis
      truly amazing from a man who seemed to delight so much in religious
      regulations and observances. Dr. Fisher himself was dissatisfied, and
      wondered at his compliance, though he attributed the plan to the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bride behaved extremely well, he said, and was all smile and
      complacency. He had never seen her to such advantage, or in such soft
      looks, before; and perfectly serene, though her sister was so much moved
      as to go into hysterics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, at seven o&rsquo;clock, the bride and bride-groom set off for
      a friend&rsquo;s house in Hertfordshire by themselves, attended by
      servants with white favours. The rest of the party, father, sister, and
      priest included, went to the play, which happened to be Benedict. <span
      class="pagenum">344</span><a name="link344" id="link344"></a> A VISIT FROM
      THE BRIDE.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall say nothing of the queen&rsquo;s birthday, but that I had a most
      beautiful trimming worked me for it by Miss Cambridge, who half fatigued
      herself to death, for the kind pleasure that I should have my decorations
      from her hands. If in some points my lot has been unenviable, what a
      constant solace, what sweet and soft amends, do I find and feel in the
      almost unexampled union of kindness and excellence in my chosen friends!
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after the birthday produced a curious scene. To soften off, by the
      air, a violent headache, I determined upon walking to Chelsea to see my
      dear father. I knew I should thus avoid numerous visitors of the
      household, who might pay their devoirs to Mrs. Schwellenberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      I missed my errand, and speedily returned, and found many cards from
      bed-chamber women and maids of honour; and, while still reading them, I
      was honoured with a call from the Bishop of Salisbury; and in two minutes
      my dear father came himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pleasant conversation was commencing, when Columb opened the door, and
      said, &ldquo;Colonel Fairly begs leave to ask you how you do.&rdquo; He
      had been married but a week before he came into the midst of all the Court
      bustle, which he had regularly attended ever since!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a good while before the door opened again and I heard a buzz of
      voices in the passage: but when it was thrown open, there appeared&mdash;the
      bride herself&mdash;and alone! She looked quite brilliant in smiles and
      spirits. I never saw a countenance so enlivened. I really believe she has
      long cherished a passionate regard for Mr. Fairly, and brightens now from
      its prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I received her with all&rsquo; the attention in my power, immediately
      wishing her joy: she accepted it with a thousand dimples, and I seated her
      on the sofa, and myself by her side. Nobody followed; and I left the
      bishop to my father, while we entered into conversation, upon the
      birthday, her new situation in being exempt from its fatigues, and other
      matters of the time being.
    </p>
    <p>
      I apologised to Mrs. Fairly for my inability to return the honour of her
      visit, but readily undertook to inform her majesty of her inquiries, which
      she earnestly begged from me, <span class="pagenum">345</span><a
      name="link345" id="link345"></a> RENEWAL OF THE HASTINGS TRIAL: A POETICAL
      IMPROMPTU.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feb. 16-Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s trial re-commenced; and her majesty
      graciously presented me with tickets for Mr. Francis, Charlotte, and
      myself. She acknowledged a very great curiosity to know whether my old
      friends amongst the managers would renew their intercourse with a Court
      friend, or include me in the distaste conceived against herself, and drop
      their visits. I had not once been to the trial the preceding year, nor
      seen any of the set since the king&rsquo;s illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were there hours before they entered, all spent in a harmony of
      converse and communication I never for three hours following can have
      elsewhere: no summons impending&mdash;no fear of accidental delay drawing
      off attention to official solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the stated time they entered in the usual form, Mr. Burke first. I felt
      so grieved a resentment of his late conduct,<a href="#linknote-326"
      name="linknoteref-326" id="linknoteref-326"><small>326</small></a> that I
      was glad to turn away from his countenance. I looked elsewhere during the
      whole procession, and their subsequent arrangement, that I might leave
      totally to themselves and their consciences whether to notice a friend
      from Court or not. Their consciences said not. No one came; I only heard
      through Charlotte that Mr. Windham was of the set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Anstruther spoke, and all others took gentle naps! I don&rsquo;t
      believe he found it out. When all was concluded, I saw one of them
      ascending towards our seats: and presently heard the voice of Mr. Burke.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wished myself many miles off! &rsquo;tis so painful to see with utter
      disapprobation those faces we have met, with joy and pleasure! He came to
      speak to some relations of Mr. Anstruther. I was next them, and, when
      recovered from my first repugnance, I thought it better to turn round, not
      to seem leading the way myself to any breach. I met his eyes immediately,
      and curtsied. He only said, &ldquo;O! is it you?&rdquo; then asked how I
      did, said something in praise of Mr. Anstruther, partly to his friends and
      partly to me&mdash;heard from me no reply&mdash;and hurried away, coldly,
      and with a look dissatisfied and uncordial. I was much concerned; and we
      came away soon after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an impromptu, said to have been written by Mr.<span class="pagenum">346</span><a
      name="link346" id="link346"></a> Hastings during Mr. Grey&rsquo;s speech,
      which was a panegyric on Mr. Philip Francis:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hurts me not, that Grey, as Burke&rsquo;s assessor, Proclaims me
      Tyrant, Robber, and Oppressor, Tho&rsquo; for abuse alone meant: For when
      he call&rsquo;d himself the bosom friend, The Friend of Philip Francis,&mdash;I
      contend He made me full atonement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was called upon, on my return, to relate the day&rsquo;s business. Heavy
      and lame was the relation but their majesties were curious, and nothing
      better suited truth.

    <h2>
      AN ILLBRED EARL OF CHESTERFIELD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our tea-party was suddenly enlarged by the entrance of the Lords
      Chesterfield, Bulkley, and Fortescue. Lord Chesterfield brought in the two
      latter without any ceremony, and never introduced nor named them, but
      chatted off with them apart, as if they were in a room to themselves: and
      Colonel Wellbred, to whom all gentlemen here belong, was out of the room
      in search of a curious snuff-box that he had promised to show to us. Major
      Price, who by great chance was seated next me, jumped up as if so many
      wild beasts had entered, and escaped to the other side of the room, and
      Mr. Willis was only a sharp looker-on.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was awkward enough for a thing so immaterial, as I could not even ask
      them to have any tea, from uncertainty how to address them; and I believe
      they were entirely ignorant whither Lord Chesterfield was bringing them,
      as they came In only to wait for a royal summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      How would that quintessence of high ton, the late Lord Chesterfield, blush
      to behold his successor! who, with much share of humour, and of good
      humour also, has as little good breeding as any mail I ever met with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take an instance.-Lord Bulkley, who is a handsome man, is immensely tall;
      the major, who is middle-sized, was standing by his chair, in close
      conference with him&mdash;&ldquo;Why, Bulkley,&rdquo; cried Lord
      Chesterfield, &ldquo;you are just the height sitting that Price is
      standing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Disconcerted a little, they slightly laughed; but Lord Bulkley rose, and
      they walked off to a greater distance. Lord Chesterfield, looking after
      them, exclaimed, &ldquo;What a <span class="pagenum">347</span><a
      name="link347" id="link347"></a> walking steeple he is!&mdash;why,
      Bulkley, you ought to cut off your legs to be on a level with society!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were all summoned away, except Mr. Willis, who has never that
      honour but in private, he lifted up his hands and eyes, and called out,
      &ldquo;I shall pity those men when the book comes out!&mdash;I would not
      be in their skins!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I understood him perfectly,&mdash;and answered, truly, that I was never
      affronted more than a minute with those by whom I could never longer be
      pleased.

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY IN A NEW CAPACITY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      March 2.&mdash;-In one of our Windsor excursions at this time, while I was
      in her majesty&rsquo;s dressing-room, with only Mr. de Luc present, she
      suddenly said, &ldquo;Prepare yourself, Miss Burney, with all your
      spirits, for to-night you must be reader.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She then added that she recollected what she had been told by my honoured
      Mrs. Delany, of my reading Shakspeare to her, and was desirous that I
      should read a play to herself and the princesses; and she had lately
      heard, from Mrs. Schwellenberg, &ldquo;nobody could do it better, when I
      would.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I assured her majesty it was rather when I could, as any reading Mrs.
      Schwellenberg had heard must wholly have been better or worse according to
      my spirits, as she had justly seemed to suggest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment coffee was over the Princess Elizabeth came for me. I found her
      majesty knotting, the princess royal drawing, Princess Augusta spinning,
      and Lady Courtown I believe in the same employment, but I saw none of them
      perfectly well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Miss Burney,&rdquo; cried the queen, &ldquo;how are your
      spirits?&mdash;How is your voice?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; cried the kind Princess Elizabeth,
      &ldquo;she shall do her best!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This had been said in attending her royal highness back. I could only
      confirm it, and that cheerfully&mdash;to hide fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not the advantage of choosing my play, nor do I know what would have
      been my decision had it fallen to my lot. Her majesty, had just begun
      Colman&rsquo;s works, and &ldquo;Polly Honeycomb&rdquo; was to open my
      campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; cried the queen most graciously, &ldquo;Miss Burney
      will read the better for drawing a chair and sitting down."<span
      class="pagenum">348</span><a name="link348" id="link348"></a> &ldquo;Wes,
      mamma! I dare say so!&rdquo; cried Princess Augusta and Princess
      Elizabeth, both in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen then told me to draw my chair close to her side. I made no
      scruples. Heaven knows I needed not the addition of standing! but most
      glad I felt in being placed thus near, as it saved a constant painful
      effort of loud reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Courtown,&rdquo; cried the queen, &ldquo;you had better draw
      nearer, for Miss Burney has the misfortune of reading rather low at first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more amiable than this opening. Accordingly, I did, as I
      had promised, my best; and, indifferent as that was, it would rather have
      surprised you, all things considered, that it was not yet worse. But I
      exerted all the courage I possess, and, having often read to the queen, I
      felt how much it behoved me not to let her surmise I had any greater awe
      to surmount.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is but a vulgar performance; and I was obliged to omit, as well as I
      could at sight, several circumstances very unpleasant for reading, and ill
      enough fitted for such hearers, it went off pretty flat. Nobody is to
      comment, nobody is to interrupt; and even between one act and another not
      a moment&rsquo;s pause is expected to be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been already informed of this etiquette by Mr. Turbulent and Miss
      Planta; nevertheless, it is not only oppressive to the reader, but loses
      to the hearers so much spirit and satisfaction, that I determined to
      endeavour, should I again be called upon, to introduce a little break into
      this tiresome and unnatural profundity of respectful solemnity. My own
      embarrassment, however, made it agree with me for the present uncommonly
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Courtown never uttered one single word the whole time; yet is she one
      of the most loquacious of our establishment. But such is the settled
      etiquette.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen has a taste for conversation, and the princesses a good-humoured
      love for it, that doubles the regret of such an annihilation of all nature
      and all pleasantry. But what will not prejudice and education inculcate?
      They have been brought up to annex silence to respect and decorum: to
      talk, therefore, unbid, or to differ from any given opinion even when
      called upon, are regarded as high improprieties, if not presumptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      They none of them do justice to their own minds, while they enforce this
      subjection upon the minds of others. I had not <span class="pagenum">349</span><a
      name="link349" id="link349"></a> experienced it before; for when reading
      alone with the queen, or listening to her reading to me, I have always
      frankly spoken almost whatever has occurred to me. But there I had no
      other examples before me, and therefore I might inoffensively be guided by
      myself; and her majesty&rsquo;s continuance of the same honour has shown
      no disapprobation of my proceeding. But here it was not easy to make any
      decision for myself: to have done what Lady Courtown forbore doing would
      have been undoubtedly a liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we all behaved alike and easily can I now conceive the disappointment
      and mortification of poor Mr. Garrick when he read &ldquo;Lethe&rdquo; to
      a royal audience. Its tameness must have tamed even him, and I doubt not
      he never acquitted himself so ill.

    <h2>
      THE LONG-FORGOTTEN TRAGEDY: MISS BURNEY AGAIN AS READER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Easter Sunday, the 4th of April, when I left my beloved Susan at St.
      James&rsquo;s, I left with her all spirit for any voluntary employment,
      and it occurred to me I could best while away the leisure allowed me by
      returning to my long-forgotten tragedy. This I have done, in those moments
      as yet given to my journal, and it is well I had so sad a resource, since
      any merrier I must have aimed at in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a year and four months since I had looked at or thought of it. I
      found nothing but unconnected speeches, and hints, and ideas, though
      enough in quantity, perhaps, for a whole play. I have now begun planning
      and methodising, and have written three or four regular scenes. I mention
      all these particulars of my progress, in answer to certain queries in the
      comments of my Susan and Fredy, both of old date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well (for that is my hack, as &ldquo;however&rdquo; is my dear Susanna&rsquo;s),
      we set off rather late for Windsor,-Mr. de Luc, Miss Planta, and myself;
      Mrs. Schwellenberg stayed in town....
    </p>
    <p>
      I invited my old beau, as her majesty calls Mr. Bryant, to dinner, and he
      made me my best day out of the ten days of our Windsor sojourn. He has
      insisted upon lending me some more books, all concerning the most distant
      parts of the earth, or on subjects the most abstruse. His singular
      simplicity in constantly conceiving that, because to him such books alone
      are new, they must have the same recommendation to me, is <span
      class="pagenum">350</span><a name="link350" id="link350"></a> extremely
      amusing; and though I do all that is possible to clear up the distinction,
      he never remembers it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, for which I was very sorry, did not come Into the room. He made
      it but one visit, indeed, during this week. He then conversed almost
      wholly with General Grenville upon the affairs of France; and in a manner
      so unaffected, open and manly, so highly superior to all despotic
      principles, even while most condemning the unlicensed fury of the Parisian
      mob, that I wished all the nations of the world to have heard him, that
      they might have known the real existence of a patriot king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reading took place, and much more comfortably; it was to the queen
      and princesses, without any lady-in-waiting. The queen, as before,
      condescended to order me to sit close to her side; and as I had no model
      before me, I scrupled much less to follow the bent of my own ideas by
      small occasional comments. And these were of use both to body and mind;
      they rested the lungs from one invariable exertion, as much as they saved
      the mind from one strain of attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our play was &ldquo;The Man of Business,&rdquo; a very good comedy, but
      too local for long life. And another of Colman&rsquo;s which I read
      afterwards has the same defect. Half the follies and peculiarities it
      satirises are wholly at an end and forgotten. Humour springing from mere
      dress, or habits, or phraseology, is quickly obsolete; when it sinks
      deeper, and dives into character, it may live for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dedicated my Wednesday evening to a very comfortable visit to our dear
      James, whose very good and deserving wife, and fine little fat children,
      with our Esther and her fair Marianne and Fanny, all cordially conspired
      to make me happy. We read a good deal of Captain Bligh&rsquo;s interesting
      narrative,<a href="#linknote-327" name="linknoteref-327"
      id="linknoteref-327"><small>327</small></a> <span class="pagenum">351</span><a
      name="link351" id="link351"></a>every word of which James has taken as
      much to heart as if it were his own production.
    </p>
    <p>
      I go on, occasionally, with my tragedy. It does not much enliven, but it
      soothes me.

      COLONEL MANNERS IN HIS SENATORIAL CAPACITY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      April 23.&mdash;-I shall add nothing at present to my Journal but the
      summary of a conversation I have had with Colonel Manners, who, at our
      last excursion, was here without any other gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing he likes to be considered as a senator, I thought the best subject
      for our discussion would be the House of Commons; I therefore made sundry
      political inquiries, so foreign to My Usual mode, that you would not a
      little have smiled to have heard them. I had been informed he had once
      made an attempt to speak, during the Regency business, last winter; I
      begged to know how the matter stood, and he made a most frank display of
      its whole circumstances. &ldquo;Why, they were speaking away,&rdquo; he
      cried, &ldquo;upon the Regency, and so,&mdash;and they were saying if the
      king could not reign, and recover; and Burke was making some of his
      eloquence, and talking; and, says he, &lsquo;hurled from his throne,&rsquo;&mdash;and
      so I put out my finger in this manner, as if I was in a great passion, for
      I felt myself very red, and I was in a monstrous passion I suppose, but I
      was only going to say &lsquo;Hear! Hear!&rsquo; but I happened to lean one
      hand down upon my knee, in this way, just as Mr. Pitt does when he wants
      to speak, and I stooped forward, just as if I was going to rise up and
      begin but just then I caught Mr. Pitt&rsquo;s eye, looking at me so
      pitifully; he thought I was going to speak, and he was frightened to
      death, for he thought&mdash;for the thing was, he got up himself, and he
      said over all I wanted to say; and the thing is, he almost always does;
      for just as I have something particular to say, Mr. Pitt begins, and goes
      through it all, so that he don&rsquo;t leave anything more to be said
      about it; and so, I suppose, as he looked at me so pitifully, he thought I
      should say it first, or else that I <span class="pagenum">352</span><a
      name="link352" id="link352"></a> should get into some scrape, because I
      was so warm and looking so red.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Any comment would disgrace this; I will therefore only tell you his
      opinion, in his own words, of one of our late taxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one tax, ma&rsquo;am, that ever I voted for
      against my conscience, for I&rsquo;ve always been very particular about
      that; but that is the bacheldor&rsquo;s tax, and that I hold to be very
      unconstitutional, and I am very sorry I voted for it, because it&rsquo;s
      very unfair; for how can a man help being a bacheldor, if nobody will have
      him? and besides, it&rsquo;s not any fault to be taxed for, because We did
      not make ourselves bacheldors, for we were made so by God, for nobody was
      born married, and so I think it&rsquo;s a very unconstitutional tax.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A CONVERSATION WITH MR. WINDHAM AT THE HASTINGS TRIAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      April 27.&mdash;I had the happiness of my dearest Fredy&rsquo;s society in
      Westminster Hall&mdash;if happiness and that place may be named together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was mixed: Evidence and Mr. Anstruther weighing it down, and Mr.
      Burke speaking from time to time, and lighting it up. O, were his purpose
      worthy his talents, what an effect would his oratory produce! I always
      hear him with so much concern, I can scarce rejoice even in being kept
      awake by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was nearly passed, and I was eating a biscuit to prevent an
      absolute doze while Mr. Anstruther was talking, when, raising myself from
      a listening bend, I turned to the left, and perceived Mr. Windham, who had
      quietly placed himself by my side without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      My surprise was so great, and so totally had I given up all idea of
      renewing our conferences, that I could scarce refrain expressing it.
      Probably it was visible enough, for he said, as if apologising for coming
      up, that so to do was the only regale their toils allowed them. He then
      regretted that it was a stupid day, and, with all his old civility about
      me and my time, declared he was always sorry to see me there when nothing
      worth attention was going forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      This soon brought us round to our former intimacy of converse; and, the
      moment I was able, I ventured at my usual inquiry about his own speaking,
      and if it would soon take place. <span class="pagenum">353</span><a
      name="link353" id="link353"></a> &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, with a
      look of great pleasure, &ldquo;I shall now not speak at all.&mdash;I have
      cleared myself from that task, and never with such satisfaction did I get
      rid of any!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazed, yet internally glad, I hazarded some further inquiry into the
      reason of this change of plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were drawing, he said, to a conclusion, and the particular charge
      which he had engaged himself to open was relinquished.<a
      href="#linknote-328" name="linknoteref-328" id="linknoteref-328"><small>328</small></a>
      &ldquo;I have therefore,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;washed my hands of making
      a speech, yet satisfied my conscience, my honour, my promises, and my
      intentions; for I have declined undertaking anything new, and no claim
      therefore remains upon me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;I am at a loss whether to be glad or
      sorry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He comprehended instantly,&mdash;glad for Mr. Hastings, or sorry for not
      hearing him. He laughed, but said something a little reproachful, upon my
      continued interest for that gentleman. I would not pretend it was
      diminished; I determined he should find me as frank as heretofore, and
      abscond, or abide, as his nerves stood the firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are never, then&rdquo; (I said afterwards), &ldquo;to speak
      here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I said a few words&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O when?&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;I am very sorry I did not know it,
      and hear you,&mdash;as you did speak!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O,&rdquo; cried he, laughing, &ldquo;I do not fear this flattery
      now, as I shall speak no more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;was the occasion that drew you
      forth?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing very material but I saw Burke run hard, and I wished to
      help him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was just,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;what I should have expected
      from you&mdash;and just what I have not been able not to honour, on some
      other occasions, even where I have most blamed the matter that has drawn
      forth the assistance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was going pretty far:&mdash;he could not but instantly feel I meant
      the Regency discussions. He neither made me any answer, nor turned his
      head, even obliquely, my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not sorry, however. &lsquo;Tis always best to be sincere. Finding
      him quite silent, to soften matters as well as I could with honesty, I
      began an éloge of Mr. Burke, both warm and true, as far as regards his
      wonderful abilities. But he soon <span class="pagenum">354</span><a
      name="link354" id="link354"></a> distinguished the rigorous precision with
      which, Involuntarily, I praised the powers without adverting to their Use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly then, and with a look of extreme keenness, he turned his eyes
      upon me, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;and he has very highly, also the
      faculty of being right!&rdquo; I would the friendship that dictated this
      assertion were as unwarped as it is animated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help saying rather faintly, &ldquo;Has he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not faintly he answered, &ldquo;He has!&mdash;but not the world alone,
      even his friends, are apt to misjudge him. What he enters upon, however
      with earnestness, YOU will commonly find turn out as he represents it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His genius, his mental faculties, and the natural goodness of his heart, I
      then praised as warmly as Mr. Windham could have praised them himself; but
      the subject ran me aground a second time, as, quite undesignedly, I
      concluded my panegyric with declaring that I found it impossible not to
      admire,&mdash;nay, love him, through all his wrong. Ending another total
      silence and averted head, I started something more general upon the trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      His openness then returned, with all its customary vivacity, and he
      expressed himself extremely irritated upon various matters which had been
      carried against the managers by the judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. Windham!&rdquo; exclaimed I, &ldquo;the judges!&mdash;is
      it possible you can enter into such a notion as to suppose Mr. Hastings
      capable of bribing them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, for capable,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, leave that word out, and suppose him even willing&mdash;can
      you imagine all the judges and all the lords&mdash;for they must concur&mdash;
      disposed to be bribed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I see them all determined to acquit Mr. Hastings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Determined?&mdash;nay, that indeed is doing him very little honour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, for honour!&mdash;if he is acquitted&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped,&mdash;as
      if that were sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ventured to ask why the judges and the lords-should make such a
      determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the general knavery and villainy of mankind.&rdquo; was his
      hard answer, &ldquo;which always wishes to abet successful guilt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried I, shaking my head, &ldquo;you have not, <span
      class="pagenum">355</span><a name="link355" id="link355"></a> relinquished
      your speech from having nothing to say. But I am glad you have
      relinquished it, for I have always been most afraid of you; and the reason
      is, those who know how to hold back will not for nothing come forward.
      There is one down there, who, if he knew how ever to hold back, would be
      great indeed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not deny this, but would not affirm it. Poor Mr. Burke!&mdash;so
      near to being wholly right, while yet wholly wrong!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Burke mounted the rostrum, Mr. Windham stopped short, saying,
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t interrupt you-&rdquo; and, in a moment, glided back
      to the managers&rsquo; box; where he stood behind Mr. Burke, evidently at
      hand to assist in any difficulty. His affection for him seems to amount to
      fondness. This is not for me to wonder at. Who was so captivated as myself
      by that extraordinary man, till he would no longer suffer me to reverence
      the talents I must still ever admire?

    <h2>
      A GLIMPSE OF MRS. PIOZZI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sunday, May 2.&mdash;This morning, in my way to church, just as I arrived
      at the iron gate of our courtyard, a well-known voice called out, &ldquo;Ah,
      there&rsquo;s Miss Burney!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I started, and looked round&mdash;and saw&mdash;Mrs. Piozzi! I hastened up
      to her; she met my held-out hand with both hers: Mr. Piozzi an Cecilia<a
      href="#linknote-329" name="linknoteref-329" id="linknoteref-329"><small>329</small></a>
      were with her&mdash;all smiling and good-humoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;to church?&mdash;so, am I.
      I must run first to the inn: I suppose one&mdash;may sit&mdash;anywhere
      one pleases?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;but you must be quick, or you will sit
      nowhere, there will be such a throng.&rdquo; This was all;&mdash;she
      hurried on,&mdash;so did I.
    </p>
    <p>
      I received exceeding great satisfaction in this little and unexpected
      meeting. She had been upon the Terrace, and was going to change her hat,
      and haste on both sides prevented awkwardness on either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I saw she had taken in good part my concluding hand-presentation at my
      dear Mr. Locke&rsquo;s:<a href="#linknote-330" name="linknoteref-330"
      id="linknoteref-330"><small>330</small></a> she met me no more <span
      class="pagenum">356</span><a name="link356" id="link356"></a> with that
      fierte of defiance: it was not&mdash;nor can it ever be with her old
      cordiality, but it was with some degree of pleasure, and that species of
      readiness which evinces a consciousness of meeting with a good reception.

    <h2>
      CAPTAIN BURNEY WANTS A SHIP AND TO GO TO COURT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      May 6.&mdash;This being the last Pantheon, I put in my long intended
      claim; and it was greatly facilitated by the circumstance of a new singer,
      Madame Benda, making her first appearance. My dearest father fetched me
      from the Queen&rsquo;s house. Esther and Marianne kept me places between
      them. Marianne never looked so pretty; I saw not a face there I thought
      equally lovely. And, oh, how Pacchierotti sung!&mdash;How-with what
      exquisite feeling, what penetrating pathos! I could almost have cried the
      whole time, that this one short song was all I should be able to hear!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the second act I was obliged to decamp. James, who had
      just found me out, was my esquire. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he cried, in our
      way to the chair, &ldquo;will there be war with Spain?&rdquo; I assured
      him I thought not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I am afraid!&rdquo; answered the true English tar. &ldquo;However,
      if there is, I should be glad of a frigate of thirty-two guns. Now, if you
      ask for it, don&rsquo;t say a frigate, and get me one of twenty-eight!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Good heaven!&mdash;poor innocent James!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And just as I reached the chair&mdash;&ldquo;But how shall you feel,&rdquo;
      he cried, &ldquo;when I ask you to desire a guard-ship for me, in about
      two years&rsquo; time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I could make no precise answer to that! He then added that he intended
      coming to Court! Very much frightened, I besought him first to come and
      drink tea with me&mdash;which he promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my way home, as I went ruminating upon this apparently but just, though
      really impracticable demand, I weighed well certain thoughts long
      revolving, and of late nearly bursting forth and the result was this&mdash;to
      try all, while yet there is time. Reproach else may aver, when too late,
      greater courage would have had greater success. This idea settled my
      resolutions, and they all bent to one point, risking all risks. <span
      class="pagenum">357</span><a name="link357" id="link357"></a> May 10.&mdash;This
      evening, by appointment came our good James and his wife, and soon
      afterwards, to my great pleasure, Captain Phillips joined us. I take it,
      therefore, for granted, he will have told all that passed in the business
      way. I was very anxious to gather more intelligibly the wishes and
      requests of poor James, and to put a stop to his coming to Court without
      taking such previous steps as are customary. I prevailed, and promised, in
      return, to make known his pretensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may believe, my dear friends, this promise was the result of the same
      wish of experiment, and sense of claim upon me of my family to make it
      while I may, that I have mentioned. I did&mdash;this very evening. I did
      it gaily, and in relating such anecdotes as were amusingly characteristic
      of a sailor&rsquo;s honest but singular notions of things: yet I have done
      it completely; his wishes and his claims are now laid open&mdash;Heaven
      knows to what effect! The Court scheme I have also told; and my royal
      mistress very graciously informed me, that if presented by some superior
      officer there could be no objection; but otherwise, unless he had some
      promotion, it was not quite usual.

    <h2>
      CAPTAIN BURNEY AND MR. WINDHAM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      May 11.&mdash;This morning my royal mistress had previously arranged for
      me that I should go to the trial, and had given me a ticket for my little
      Sarah<a href="#linknote-331" name="linknoteref-331" id="linknoteref-331"><small>331</small></a>
      to accompany me; and late last night, I believe after twelve o&rsquo;clock,
      she most graciously gave me another for James. Just at this time she could
      not more have gratified me than by a condescension to my dear brother.
      Poor Columb was sent with the intelligence, and directions for our meeting
      at seven o&rsquo;clock this morning, to Norton-street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah came early; but James was so late we were obliged to leave word for
      him to follow us. He did,&mdash;two hours afterwards! by way of being our
      esquire; and then told me he knew it would be in good time, and so he had
      stopped to breakfast at Sir Joseph Banks&rsquo;s. I suppose the truth is,
      it saved him a fresh puff of powder for some other day.
    </p>
    <p>
      We talked over all affairs, naval and national, very comfortably. The
      trial is my only place for long dialogues! I gave him a new and earnest
      charge that he would not speak home concerning the prosecution to Mr.
      Winndham, should he join<span class="pagenum">358</span><a name="link358"
      id="link358"></a> us. He made me a less reluctant promise than heretofore,
      for when last with Charlotte at Aylsham he had frequently visited Mr.
      Windham, and had several battles at draughts or backgammon with him; and
      there is no Such good security against giving offence as seeing ourselves
      that our opponents are worth pleasing. Here, too, as I told James, however
      we might think all the managers in the wrong, they were at least open
      enemies, and acting a public part, and therefore they must fight it out,
      as he would do with the Spaniards, if, after all negotiation, they came to
      battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He allowed this; and promised to leave him to the attacks of the little
      privateer, without falling foul of him with a broadside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the trial began Mr. Windham came up to us, and after a few
      minutes&rsquo; chat with me addressed himself to James about the
      approaching war. &ldquo;Are you preparing,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;for a
      campaign?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not such one,&rdquo; cried James, &ldquo;as we had last summer at
      Aylsham!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what officers you are!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you men of
      Captain Cook; you rise upon us in every trial! This Captain Bligh,&mdash;what
      feats, what wonders he has performed! What difficulties got through! What
      dangers defied! And with such cool, manly skill!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked the narrative over as far as Mr. Windham had in Manuscript
      seen its sketch; but as I had not read it, I could not enter into its
      detail.

    <h2>
      MR. WINDHAM SPEAKS ON A LEGAL POINT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Windham took his seat by my elbow, and renewed one of his old style of
      conversations about the trial; each of us firmly maintaining our original
      ground. I believe he has now relinquished his expectation of making me a
      convert. He surprised me soon by saying, &ldquo;I begin to fear, after
      all, that what you have been talking about to me will come to pass.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I found he meant his own speaking upon a new charge, which, when I last
      saw him, he exultingly told me was given up. He explained the apparent
      inconsistency by telling me that some new change of plan had taken place,
      and that Mr. Burke was extremely urgent with him to open the next charge:
      &ldquo;And I cannot,&rdquo; he cried emphatically, &ldquo;leave Burke in
      the lurch!&rdquo; I both believed and applauded him so far; but why<span
      class="pagenum">359</span><a name="link359" id="link359"></a> are either
      of them engaged in a prosecution so uncoloured by necessity?
    </p>
    <p>
      One chance he had still of escaping this tremendous task, he told me,
      which was that it might devolve upon Grey but Burke, he did not disavow,
      wished it to be himself. &ldquo;However,&rdquo; he laughingly added,
      &ldquo;I think we may toss up. In that case, how I wish he may lose! not
      only from believing him the abler enemy, but to reserve his name from
      amongst the active list in such a cause.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bewailed,&mdash;with an arch look that showed his consciousness I
      should like the lamentation,&mdash;that he was now all unprepared,&mdash;all
      fresh to begin in documents and materials, the charge being wholly new and
      unexpected, and that which he had considered relinquished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad, however,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;your original charge is
      given up; for I well remember what you said of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might be flattered,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;and enough, that you
      should remember anything I say&mdash;did I not know it was only for the
      sake of its subject,&rdquo;&mdash;looking down upon Mr. Hastings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not possibly deny this but added that I recollected he had
      acknowledged his charge was to prove Mr. Hastings mean, pitiful, little,
      and fraudulent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial this day consisted almost wholly in dispute upon evidence the
      managers offered such as the counsel held improper, and the judges and
      lords at last adjourned to debate the matter in their own chamber. Mr.
      Burke made a very fine speech upon the rights of the prosecutor to bring
      forward his accusation, for the benefit of justice, in such mode as
      appeared most consonant to his own reason and the nature of things,
      according to their varying appearances as fresh and fresh matter Occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The counsel justly alleged the hardship to the client, if thus liable to
      new allegations and suggestions, for which he came unprepared, from a
      reliance that those publicly given were all against which he need arm
      himself, and that, if those were disproved, he was cleared; while the
      desultory and shifting charges of the managers put him out in every method
      of defence, by making it impossible to him to discern where he might be
      attacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of this debate I observed Mr. Windham so agitated and so
      deeply attentive, that it prepared me for what soon followed: he mounted
      the rostrum-for the third time only since this trial commenced. <span
      class="pagenum">360</span><a name="link360" id="link360"></a> His speech
      was only to a point Of law respecting evidence he kept close to his
      subject, with a clearness and perspicuity very uncommon indeed amongst
      these orators. His voice, however, is greatly in his disfavour; for he
      forces it so violently, either from earnestness or a fear of not being
      heard, that, though it answered the purpose of giving the most perfect
      distinctness to what he uttered, its sound had an unpleasing and crude
      quality that amazed and disappointed me. The command of his language and
      fluency of his delivery, joined to the compact style of his reasoning and
      conciseness of his arguments, were all that could answer my expectations:
      but his manner&mdash;whether from energy or secret terror&mdash;lost all
      its grace, and by no means seemed to belong to the elegant and high-bred
      character that had just quitted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In brief,&mdash;how it may happen I know not,&mdash;but he certainly does
      not do justice to his own powers and talents in public. He was excessively
      agitated: when he had done and dismounted, I saw his pale face of the most
      fiery red. Yet he had uttered nothing in a passion. It must have been
      simply from internal effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The counsel answered him, and he mounted to reply. Here, indeed, he did
      himself honour; his readiness of answer, the vivacity of his objections,
      and the instantaneous command of all his reasoning faculties, were truly
      striking. Had what he said not fallen in reply to a speech but that moment
      made, I must have concluded it the result Of Study, and all harangue
      learnt by heart. He was heard with the most marked attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second speech, like the first, was wholly upon the laws of evidence,
      and Mr. Hastings was not named in either. He is certainly practising
      against his great day. And, in truth, I hold still to my fear of it; for,
      however little his manner in public speaking may keep pace with its
      promise in private conversation, his matter was tremendously pointed and
      severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial of the day concluded by an adjournment to consult upon the
      evidence in debate, with the judges, in the House of Lords.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Windham came up to the seats of the Commons in my neighbourhood, but
      not to me; he spoke to the Misses Francis,&mdash;daughters of Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s
      worst foe,&mdash;and hurried down.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my return I was called upon to give an account of the <span
      class="pagenum">361</span><a name="link361" id="link361"></a> trial to
      their majesties and the princesses, and a formidable business, I assure

    <h2>
      AN EMPHATIC PERORATION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      May 18.&mdash;This morning I again went to the trial of poor Mr. Hastings.
      Heavens! who can see him sit there unmoved? not even those who think him
      guilty,&mdash;if they are human.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took with me Mrs. Bogle. She had long since begged a ticket for her
      husband, which I could never before Procure. We now went all three. And,
      indeed, her original speeches and remarks made a great part of my
      entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hastings and his counsel were this day most victorious. I never saw
      the prosecutors so dismayed. Yet both Mr. Burke and Mr. Fox spoke, and
      before the conclusion so did Mr. Windham. They were all in evident
      embarrassment. Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s counsel finished the day, with a most
      noble appeal to justice and innocence, protesting that, if his client did
      not fairly claim the one, by proving the other, he wished himself that the
      prosecutors-that the lords&mdash;that the nation at large&mdash;that the
      hand of God&mdash;might fall heavy upon him!
    </p>
    <p>
      This had a great and sudden effect,&mdash;not a word was uttered. The
      prosecutors looked dismayed and astonished; and the day closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Windham came up to speak to Misses Francis about a dinner: but he
      only, bowed to me, and with a look so conscious&mdash;so much saying,
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis your turn to triumph now!&rdquo; that I had not the
      spite to attack him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the counsel had uttered this animated speech, Mrs. Bogle was so
      much struck, she hastily arose, and, clapping her hands, called out
      audibly, in a broad Scotch accent, &ldquo;O, charming!&rdquo; I could
      hardly, quiet her till I assured her we should make a paragraph for the
      newspapers. I had the pleasure to deliver this myself to their majesties,
      and the princesses&mdash;and as I was called upon while it was fresh in my
      memory, I believe but little of the general energy was forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gave me great pleasure to repeat so striking an affirmation of the
      innocence of so high, so injured I believe, a character. The queen eagerly
      declared I should go again the next sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday, May 19.&mdash;-The real birthday of my royal mistress, to whom
      may Heaven grant many, many and prosperous! Dressing, and so forth, filled
      up all the morning <span class="pagenum">362</span><a name="link362"
      id="link362"></a> and at night I had a tete-a-tete with Charles, till
      twelve. I got to bed about five in the morning. The sweet princesses had a
      ball, and I could not lament my fatigue.

    <h2>
      AN APTITUDE FOR LOGIC AND FOR GREEK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      May 20.&mdash;To-day again to the trial, to which I took MISS Young, her
      majesty having given me two tickets very late overnight. Miss Young is
      singularly, as far as I can see, the reverse of her eccentric parents she
      is moderation personified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Windham again spoke in the course of this morning&rsquo;s business,
      which was chiefly occupied in debating on the admissibility of the
      evidence brought forward by the prosecutors. The quickness and aptness of
      his arguments, with the admirable facility and address with which he
      seized upon those of his opponents, the counsel, were strong marks of that
      high and penetrating capacity so strikingly his characteristic. The only
      defect in his speaking is the tone of his voice, which, from exertion,
      loses all its powers of modulation, and has a crude accent and expression
      very disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the examination of Mr. Anderson, one of Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s best
      friends,&mdash;a sensible, well-bred, and gentlemanlike man,&mdash;Mr.
      Windham came up to my elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can this man,&rdquo; cried he, presently, &ldquo;this man&mdash;so
      gentle&mdash;be guilty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I accused him of making a point to destroy all admiration of gentleness in
      my opinion. &ldquo;But you are grown very good now!&rdquo; I added,
      &ldquo;No, very bad I mean!&rdquo; He knew I meant for speaking; and I
      then gave him burlesqued, various definitions of good, which had fallen
      from Mr. Fox in my hearing, the most contradictory, and, taken out of
      their place, the most ridiculous imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed very much, but seriously confessed that technical terms and
      explanations had better have been wholly avoided by them all, as the
      counsel were sure to out-technicalise them, and they were then exposed to
      greater embarrassments than by steering clear of the attempt, and resting
      only upon their common forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one praise,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;which I am always sure
      to meet in the newspapers whenever I meet with your name; and I begin to
      quite tire of seeing it for you,-your skill in logic!&rdquo; <span
      class="pagenum">363</span><a name="link363" id="link363"></a> &ldquo;O, I
      thank you,&rdquo; he cried, earnestly &ldquo;I am indeed quite ashamed of
      the incessant misappropriation of that word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried I; &ldquo;I only tire of it because they seem
      to think, when once the word logic and your name are combined, they have
      completely stated all. However, in what little I have heard, I could have
      suspected you to have been prepared with a speech ready written, had I not
      myself heard just before all the arguments which it answered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I then added that I was the less surprised at this facility of language,
      from having heard my brother declare he knew no man who read Greek with
      that extraordinary rapidity&mdash;no, not Dr. Parr, nor any of the
      professed Grecians, whose peculiar study it had been through life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This could be nothing, he said, but partiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not mine, at least,&rdquo; cried I, laughing, &ldquo;for Greek
      excellence is rather Out Of my sphere of panegyric!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried he, laughing too at my disclaiming, &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis&rsquo;
      your brother&rsquo;s partiality. However, &rsquo;tis one I must try not to
      lose. I must take to my Greek exercises again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They will do you a world of good, thought I, if they take you but from
      your prosecution-exercises.

    <h2>
      MORE TALK WITH MR. WINDHAM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We then talked of Mr. Burke. &ldquo;How finely,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;he
      has spoken! with what fullness of intelligence, and what fervour!&rdquo;
      He agreed, with delighted concurrence. &ldquo;Yet,&mdash;so much so long!&rdquo;
      I added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True!&rdquo; cried he, ingenuously, yet concerned. &ldquo;What pity
      he can never stop!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I enumerated some of the diffuse and unnecessary paragraphs which
      had weakened his cause, as well as his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was perfectly candid, though always with some reluctance. &ldquo;But a
      man who speaks in public,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;should never forget what
      will do for his auditors: for himself alone, it is not enough to think;
      but for what is fitted, and likely to be interesting to them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants nothing,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;but a flapper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he takes flapping inimitably.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, then,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;should be his flapper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sometimes,&rdquo; said he, smiling, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I often see,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;of what use you are to him. I
      <span class="pagenum">364</span><a name="link364" id="link364"></a> see
      you watching him,&mdash;reminding, checking him in turn,&mdash;at least, I
      fancy all this as I look into the managers&rsquo; box, which is no small
      amusement to me,&mdash;when there is any commotion there!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed; but I never diminished from the frank unfriendliness to the
      cause with which I began. But I assured him I saw but too well how
      important and useful he was to them, even without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; cried he, laughing, &ldquo;more than with speaking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not meaning to talk Of that now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but
      yet, one thing I will tell you: I hear you more distinctly than any one;
      the rest I as often miss as catch, except when they turn this way,&mdash;a
      favour Which you never did me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, indeed!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;to abstract myself from
      all, is all that enables me to get on.&rdquo; And then, with his native
      candour, he cast aside prejudice, and very liberally praised several
      points in this poor persecuted great man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had seen,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;an initiation from Horace, which
      had manifested, I presumed, his scholarship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, ay,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;an Ode to Mr. Shore, who is one of
      the next witnesses. Burke was going to allude to it, but I begged him not.
      I do not like to make their lordships smile in this grave business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so right!&rdquo; cried I: &ldquo;Ah, you know it <i>is</i>
      you and your attack I have feared most all along!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This flattery&rdquo;&mdash;cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not use that word any more, Mr. Windham,&rdquo; interrupted I;
      &ldquo;if you do, I shall be tempted to make a very shocking speech to you&mdash;the
      very reverse of flattery, I assure you.&rdquo; He stared,&mdash;and I went
      on. &ldquo;I shall say,&mdash;that those who think themselves flattered&mdash;flatter
      themselves!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&mdash;hey?&mdash;How?&rdquo; cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, they cannot conclude themselves flattered, without concluding
      they have de quoi to make it worth while!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there&mdash;there may be something In that but not here!&mdash;no,
      here it must flow simply front general benevolence,&mdash;from a wish to
      give comfort or pleasure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I disclaimed all and turned his attention again to Mr. Hastings. &ldquo;See!&rdquo;
      I cried, &ldquo;see but how thin&mdash;how ill&mdash;looks that poor
      little uncle of yours!&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-332" name="linknoteref-332"
      id="linknoteref-332"><small>332</small></a> Again I upbraided him with
      being unnatural; and lamented Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum">365</span><a
      name="link365" id="link365"></a> change since I had known him in former
      days. &ldquo;And shall I tell you,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;something in
      which you had nearly been involved with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&mdash;with Mr. Hastings?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! and I regret it did not happen! You may recollect my
      mentioning my original acquaintance with him, before I lived where I now
      do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but where you now... I understand you,&mdash;expect ere long
      you may see him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He meant from his acquittal, and reception at the Queen&rsquo;s house. And
      I would not contradict him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, however,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;my acquaintance and regard
      began very fairly while I lived at home at my father&rsquo;s and indeed I
      regret you could not then and so have known him, as I am satisfied you
      would have been pleased with him, which now you cannot judge. He is so
      gentle-mannered, so intelligent, so unassuming, yet so full-minded.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have understood that,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;yet &rsquo;tis
      amazing how little unison there may be between mariners and characters,
      and how softly gentle a man may appear without, whose nature within is all
      ferocity and cruelty. This is a part of mankind of which you cannot judge&mdash;of
      which, indeed, you can scarce form an idea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few comments I continued what I had to say, which, in fact, was
      nothing but another malice of my own against him. I reminded him of one
      day in a former year of this trial, when I had the happiness of sitting at
      it with my dearest Mrs. Locke, in which he had been so obliging, with
      reiterated offers, as to propose seeing for my servant, etc.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I was afterwards extremely sorry I
      had not accepted your kindness; for just as we were going away, who should
      be passing, and turn back to speak to me, but Mr. Hastings! &lsquo;O!&rsquo;
      he cried, ‘I must come here to see you, I find!&rsquo; Now, had you but
      been with me at that moment! I own it would have been the greatest
      pleasure to me to have brought you together though I am quite at a loss to
      know whether I ought, in that case, to have presented you to each other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed most heartily,-half, probably, with joy at his escape; but he
      had all his wits about him in his answer. &ldquo;If you,&rdquo; he cried,
      &ldquo;had been between US, we might, for once, have coalesced&mdash;in
      both bowing to the same shrine!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">366</span><a

    <h2>
      SECTION 17. (1790-1) MISS BURNEY RESIGNS HER PLACE AT COURT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      [The following section concludes the story of Fanny&rsquo;s life at Court.
      Her entire unfitness for the position which she there occupied had been,
      from the commencement, no secret to herself; but her tenderness for her
      father had determined her to endure to the utmost before resigning a place
      to which her appointment had been to him, in his short-sighted folly, a
      source of such extreme gratification. But now she could endure no longer.
      The occasional relief which she had found in the society of Mrs. Delany
      and Colonel Digby had been brought to an end by the death of the one and
      the marriage of the other; her spirits were broken, her state of health
      was becoming daily more alarming and she at last summoned up courage to
      consult her father on the subject, and to make known to him her desire of
      resigning. Blind as he had shown himself to the true interests of his
      daughter, Dr. Burney was still the most affectionate of parents. He heard
      Fanny&rsquo;s complaint with grief and disappointment, but with instant
      acquiescence in her wishes. His consent to her plan being obtained, Fanny
      for some months took no further steps in the matter. She was willing to
      remain at her post so long as she was capable, with whatever difficulty,
      of supporting its fatigues. But her health failed more and more, and the
      memorial was at last (December, 1790) presented to the queen. Even yet the
      day of release was far distant. The &ldquo;sweet queen&rdquo; was in no
      hurry to part with so faithful a servant, and although she had accepted
      the resignation, she did not conceal her displeasure at being reminded of
      it. Meanwhile the unfortunate victim of royal selfishness was growing
      daily weaker. Her friends were seriously alarmed: even her fellow-slaves
      at Court commiserated her, and urged her retirement. A successor was at
      length appointed, and on the 7th of July, 1791, Fanny found herself once
      more free. <span class="pagenum">367</span><a name="link367" id="link367"></a>
      During the interval which elapsed between the consultation with Dr. Burney
      and the presentation of the memorial, an incident occurred which
      occasioned to Fanny much distress and not a little annoyance. Her own
      narrative of the affair we have not thought it necessary to include in our
      selection from the &ldquo;Diary,&rdquo; but here a few words on the
      subject may be not unacceptable. Fanny&rsquo;s man-servant, a Swiss named
      Jacob Columb, had fallen dangerously ill in the summer of 1790, and was
      sent, in August, to St. George&rsquo;s Hospital. He was much attached to
      his mistress, who, he said, had treated him with greater kindness than
      father, mother, or any of his relatives, and on leaving Windsor he begged
      her to hold in trust for him the little money in his possession, amounting
      to ten guineas. She offered him a receipt for the money, but he refused
      it, and when she insisted, exclaimed, &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, I won&rsquo;t
      take it! You know what it is, and I know what it is; and if I live I&rsquo;m
      sure you won&rsquo;t wrong me: and if I don&rsquo;t, nobody else sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      have it!&rdquo; Moved to tears by the poor fellow&rsquo;s earnestness,
      Fanny complied with his request. In the following month he died at the
      hospital, desiring, in his last moments, to leave everything to his
      sisters in Switzerland. &ldquo;He certainly meant,&rdquo; writes Fanny,
      &ldquo;everything of his wearing apparel, watches, etc., for what money he
      had left in my hands he would never tell anybody.&rdquo; She was
      preparing, accordingly, to transmit Columb&rsquo;s effects, including, of
      course, the ten guineas, to Switzerland, when a claimant appeared in the
      person of Peter Bayond, a countryman of the deceased. This man produced a
      will, purporting to be Columb&rsquo;s, by which the property was left to
      be divided between Bayond himself and James Columb, a cousin of the
      pretended testator, then in service with Horace Walpole. Fanny&rsquo;s
      instant conviction was that the will was a forgery, and the appearance and
      behaviour of Bayond confirmed her in this belief. James Columb, moreover,
      concurred in her opinion, and she had decided to ignore this new claim,
      when she received an attorney&rsquo;s letter, desiring her to pay to
      Bayond the sum in her hands of the late Jacob Columb. She then wrote to
      Walpole, who offered her his assistance, with many expressions of warm
      regard. But finally, after much trouble, and threats of a lawsuit, she was
      advised that her best plan would be to let the will take its course, and
      to pay over to the claimant the sum in question; and thus the matter was
      settled, &ldquo;in a manner,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;the most mortifying
      to Mr. Walpole and myself."-ED.]<span class="pagenum">368</span><a

    <h2>
      A MELANCHOLY CONFESSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      May 25.&mdash;The Princess Augusta condescended to bring me a most
      gracious message from the king, desiring to know if I wished to go to
      Handel&rsquo;s Commemoration, and if I should like the &ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo;
      or prefer any other day?
    </p>
    <p>
      With my humble acknowledgments for his goodness, I fixed instantly on the
      &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; and the very amiable princess came smiling back to
      me, bringing me my ticket from the king. This would not, indeed, much have
      availed me, but that I fortunately knew my dear father meant to go to the
      Abbey. I despatched Columb to Chelsea, and he promised to call for me the
      next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      My &ldquo;Visions&rdquo; I had meant to produce in a few days; and to know
      their chance before I left town for the summer.<a href="#linknote-333"
      name="linknoteref-333" id="linknoteref-333"><small>333</small></a> But I
      thought the present opportunity not to be slighted, for some little
      opening, that might lighten the task of the exordium upon the day of
      attempt. He was all himself&mdash;all his native self&mdash;kind, gay,
      open, and full fraught with converse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chance favoured me: we found so little room, that we were fain to accept
      two vacant places at once, though they separated us from my uncle, Mr.
      Burney, and his brother James, who were all there, and all meant to be of
      the same party.
    </p>
    <p>
      I might not, at another time, have rejoiced in this disunion, but it was
      now most opportune: it gave me three hours&rsquo; conference with my
      dearest father&mdash;the only conference of that length I have had in four
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune again was kind; for my father began relating various anecdotes of
      attacks made upon him for procuring to sundry strangers some acquaintance
      with his daughter,<a href="#linknote-334" name="linknoteref-334"
      id="linknoteref-334"><small>334</small></a> particularly with the Duchesse
      de Biron, and the Mesdames de Boufflers<a href="#linknote-335"
      name="linknoteref-335" id="linknoteref-335"><small>335</small></a> to whom
      he answered, he had no power; but was somewhat<span class="pagenum">369</span><a
      name="link369" id="link369"></a> struck by the question of Madame de B. in
      return, who exclaimed, &ldquo;Mais, monsieur, est-ce possible!
      Mademoiselle votre fille n&rsquo;a-t-elle point de vacance?"<a
      href="#linknote-336" name="linknoteref-336" id="linknoteref-336"><small>336</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This led to much interesting discussion, and to many confessions and
      explanations on my part, never made before; which induced him to enter
      more fully into the whole of the situation, and its circumstances, than he
      had ever yet had the leisure or the spirits to do; and he repeated sundry
      speeches of discontent at my seclusion from the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this encouraged me to much detail: I spoke my high and constant
      veneration for my royal mistress, her merits, her virtues, her
      condescension, and her even peculiar kindness towards me. But I owned the
      species of life distasteful to me; I was lost to all private comfort, dead
      to all domestic endearment; I was worn with want of rest, and fatigued
      with laborious watchfulness and attendance. My time was devoted to
      official duties; and all that in life was dearest to me&mdash;my friends,
      my chosen society, my best affections&mdash;lived now in my mind only by
      recollection, and rested upon that with nothing but bitter regret. With
      relations the most deservedly dear, with friends of almost unequalled
      goodness, I lived like an orphan-like one who had no natural ties, and
      must make her way as she could by those that were factitious. Melancholy
      was the existence where happiness was excluded, though not a complaint
      could be made! where the illustrious personages who were served possessed
      almost all human excellence, yet where those who were their servants,
      though treated with the most benevolent condescension, could never, in any
      part of the live-long day, command liberty, or social intercourse, or
      repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence of my dearest father now silencing myself, I turned to look at
      him; but how was I struck to see his honoured head bowed down almost into
      his bosom with dejection and discomfort!&mdash;we were both perfectly
      still a few moments; but when he raised his head I could hardly keep my
      seat, to see his eyes filled with tears!&mdash;&ldquo;I have long,&rdquo;
      he cried, &ldquo;been uneasy, though I have not spoken; but if you wish to
      resign, my house, my purse, my arms, shall be open to receive you, back;"<span
      class="pagenum">370</span><a name="link370" id="link370"></a> The emotion
      of my whole heart at this speech-this sweet, this generous speech&mdash;O
      my dear friends, I need not say it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were mutually forced to break up our conference. I could only instantly
      accept his paternal offer, and tell him it was my guardian angel, it was
      Providence in its own benignity, that inspired him with such goodness. I
      begged him to love the day in which he had given me such comfort, and
      assured him it would rest upon my heart with grateful pleasure till it
      ceased to beat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He promised to drink tea with me before I left town, and settle all our
      proceedings. I acknowledged my intention to have ventured to solicit this
      very permission of resigning. &ldquo;But I,&rdquo; cried he, smiling with
      the sweetest kindness, &ldquo;have spoken first myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What a joy to me, what a relief, this very circumstance! it will always
      lighten any evil that may, unhappily, follow this proposed step.

    <h2>
      CAPTAIN BURNEY&rsquo;S LACONIC LETTER AND INTERVIEW.
    </h2>
    <p>
      June.&mdash;I went again to the trial of poor Mr. Hastings: Mrs. Ord
      received from me my companion ticket, kindly giving up the Duke of
      Newcastle&rsquo;s box to indulge me with her company.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I must mention an extraordinary circumstance that happened in the last
      week. I received in a parcel&mdash;No, I will recite it you as I told it
      to Mr. Windham, who, fortunately, saw and came up to me&mdash;fortunately,
      I say, as the business of the day was very unedifying, and as Mrs. Ord
      much wished to hear some of his conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He inquired kindly about James and his affairs, and if he had yet a ship;
      and, to let him see a person might reside in a Court, and yet have no
      undue influence, I related his proceedings with Lord Chatham, and his
      laconic letter and interview. The first running thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord,&mdash;I should be glad of an audience; if your Lordship
      will be so good to appoint a time, I will wait upon you. I am, my Lord,
      your humble servant, James Burney.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray,&rdquo; quoth I to James, when he told me this, &ldquo;did
      you not say the honour of an audience?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">371</span><a
      name="link371" id="link371"></a> &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;I
      was civil enough without that; I said, If you will be so good&mdash;that
      was very civil&mdash;and honour is quite left off now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How comic! to run away proudly from forms and etiquettes, and then pretend
      it was only to be more in the last mode. Mr. Windham enjoyed this
      characteristic trait very much; and he likes James so well that he
      deserved it, as well as the interview which ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Captain Burney?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I should be glad to be employed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be sensible, Captain Burney, we have many claimants just
      now, and more than it is possible to satisfy immediately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sensible of that, my lord; but, at the same time, I wish
      to let your lordship know what I should like to have&mdash;a frigate of
      thirty-two guns.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to know what you wish, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took out his pocket-book, made a memorandum, and wished James a good
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not it occurred to Mr. Windham, while I told this, that there
      seemed a shorter way to Lord Chatham, and one more in his own style, I
      know not: he was too delicate to let such a hint escape, and I would not
      for the world intrust him with my applications and disappointments.

    <h2>
      BURKE&rsquo;S SPEECH ON THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have found,&rdquo; cried I afterwards, &ldquo;another
      newspaper praise for you now, &lsquo;Mr. Windham, with his usual vein of
      irony.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I saw that! But what can it mean?&mdash;I
      use no &lsquo;vein of irony;&rsquo;&mdash;I dislike it, except for
      peculiar purposes, keenly handled, and soon passed over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet this is the favourite panegyric you receive continually,&mdash;this,
      or logic, always attends your name in the newspapers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do I use it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, not to me, I own. As a manner, I never found it out, at least.
      However, I am less averse now than formerly to the other panegyric&mdash;close
      logic,&mdash;for I own the more frequently I come hither the more
      convinced I find myself that that is no character of commendation to be
      given universally.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He could say nothing to this; and really the dilatory,<span class="pagenum">372</span><a
      name="link372" id="link372"></a> desultory style of these prosecutors in
      general deserved a much deeper censure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a little closeness of logic and reasoning were observed by one I
      look at now, what a man would he be, and who could compare with him!&rdquo;
      Mr. Burke you are sure was here my object; and his entire, though silent
      and unwilling, assent was obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a speech,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;has he lately made!<a
      href="#linknote-337" name="linknoteref-337" id="linknoteref-337"><small>337</small></a>
      how noble, how energetic, how enlarged throughout!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O,&rdquo; cried he, very unaffectedly, &ldquo;upon the French
      Revolution?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and any party might have been proud of it, for liberality, for
      feeling, for all in one&mdash;genius. I, who am only a reader of detached
      speeches, have read none I have thought its equal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, such as you have seen it, it does not do him justice. I was
      not in the House that day; but I am assured the actual speech, as he spoke
      it at the moment, was highly superior to what has since been printed.
      There was in it a force&mdash;there were shades of reflection so fine&mdash;allusions
      so quick and so happy&mdash;and strokes of satire and observation so
      pointed and so apt,&mdash;that it had ten times more brilliancy when
      absolutely extempore than when transmitted to paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful, wonderful! He is a truly wonderful creature!&rdquo; And,
      alas, thought I, as wonderful in inconsistency as in greatness!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of a discussion more detailed upon faculties, I ventured to
      tell him what impression they had made upon James, who was with me during
      one of the early long speeches. &ldquo;I was listening,&rdquo; I said,
      with the most fervent<span class="pagenum">373</span><a name="link373"
      id="link373"></a> attention, &ldquo;to such strokes of eloquence as, while
      I heard them, carried all before them, when my brother pulled me by the
      sleeve to exclaim, &lsquo;When will he come to the point?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The justness, notwithstanding his characteristic conciseness, of this
      criticism, I was glad thus to convey. Mr. Windham however, would not
      subscribe to it; but, with a significant smile, coolly said, &ldquo;Yes,
      &rsquo;tis curious to hear a man of war&rsquo;s ideas of rhetoric.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; quoth I, to make a little amends, &ldquo;shall I tell
      you a compliment he paid you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. &lsquo;He speaks to the purpose,&rsquo; he cried.&rdquo;

      place to see Stuart&rsquo;s Athenian architecture, and whom do you think I
      met in the room?&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Nay, &rsquo;tis precisely what you will like&mdash;Mr. Hastings!&rdquo;

      glad to hear it. I only wish you could both meet without either knowing
      the other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>

      ONE TRAGEDY FINISHED AND ANOTHER COMMENCED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      August.-As I have only my almanac memorandums for this month, I shall
      hasten immediately to what I think my dear partial lecturers will find
      most to their taste in the course of it. <span class="pagenum">374</span><a
      name="link374" id="link374"></a> Know then, fair ladies, about the middle
      of this August, 17 90, the author finished the rough first draft and copy
      of her first tragedy. What species of a composition it may prove she is
      very unable to tell; she only knows it was an almost spontaneous work, and
      soothed the melancholy of imagination for a while, though afterwards it
      impressed it with a secret sensation of horror, so like real woe, that she
      believes it contributed to the injury her sleep received about this
      period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, whether well or ill, she is pleased to have done something
      at last, she had so long lived in all ways as nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will smile, however, at my next trust; but scarce was this
      completed,-as to design and scenery I mean, for the whole is in its first
      rough state, and legible only to herself, scarce, however, had this done
      with imagination, to be consigned over to correction, when imagination
      seized upon another subject for another tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first therefore I have deposited in my strong-box, in all its
      imperfections, to attend to the other; I well know correction may always
      be summoned, Imagination never will come but by choice. I received her,
      therefore, a welcome guest,&mdash;the best adapted for softening weary
      solitude, where only coveted to avoid irksome exertion.

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY&rsquo;s RESIGNATION MEMORIAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      October.-I now drew up my memorial, or rather, showed it to my dearest
      father. He so much approved it, that he told me he would not have a comma
      of it altered. I will copy it for you. It is as respectful and as grateful
      as I had words at command to make it, and expressive of strong devotion
      and attachment; but it fairly and firmly states that my strength is
      inadequate to the duties of my charge, and, therefore, that I humbly crave
      permission to resign it and retire into domestic life. It was written in
      my father&rsquo;s name and my own. I had now that dear father&rsquo;s
      desire to present it upon the first auspicious moment: and O! with what a
      mixture of impatience and dread unspeakable did I look forward to such an
      opportunity!
    </p>
    <p>
      The war was still undecided: still I inclined to wait its issue, as I
      perpetually brought in my wishes for poor James, though without avail.
      Major Garth, our last equerry, was raised to a high post in the West
      Indies, and the rank of colonel, I recommended James to his notice and
      regard if <span class="pagenum">375</span><a name="link375" id="link375"></a>
      they met; and a promise most readily and pleasantly made to seek him out
      and present him to his brother, the general, if they ever served in the
      same district, was all, I think, that my Court residence obtained for my
      marine department of interest!
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, one morning at Kew, Miss Cambridge was so much alarmed at my
      declining state of health that she would take no denial to my seeing and
      consulting Mr. Dundas. He ordered me the bark, and it strengthened me so
      much for awhile, that I was too much recruited for presenting my sick
      memorial, which I therefore cast aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ord spent near a week at Windsor in the beginning of this month. I
      was ill, however, the whole time, and suffered so much from my official
      duties, that my good Mrs. Ord, day after day, evidently lost something
      more and more of her partiality to my station, from witnessing fatigues of
      which she had formed no idea, and difficulties and disagreeabilities in
      carrying on a week&rsquo;s intercourse, even with so respectable a friend,
      which I believe she had thought impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three times she burst forth into ejaculations strongly expressive
      of fears for my health and sorrow at its exhausting calls. I could not but
      be relieved in my own mind that this much-valued, most maternal friend
      should thus receive a conviction beyond all powers of representation, that
      my place was of a sort to require a strength foreign to my make.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left me in great and visible uneasiness, and wrote to me continually
      for bills of health, I never yet so much loved her, for, kind as I have
      always found her, I never yet saw in her so much true tenderness.

    <p>
      In this month, also, I first heard of the zealous exertions and chivalrous
      intentions of Mr. Windham. Charles told me they never met without his
      demounting the whole thunders of his oratory against the confinement by
      which he thought my health injured; with his opinion that it must be
      counteracted speedily by elopement, no other way seeming effectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with Charlotte he came more home to the point. Their vicinity in
      Norfolk occasions their meeting, though very seldom at the house of Mr.
      Francis, who resents his prosecution of Mr. Hastings, and never returns
      his visits; but at assemblies at Aylsham and at Lord Buckingham&rsquo;s
      dinners they are certain of now and then encountering. <span
      class="pagenum">376</span><a name="link376" id="link376"></a> This summer,
      when Mr. Windham went to Felbrig, his Norfolk seat, they soon met at an
      assembly, and he immediately opened upon his disapprobation of her sister&rsquo;s
      monastic life, adding, &ldquo;I do not venture to speak thus freely upon
      this subject to everybody, but to you I think I may; at least, I hope it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor dear Charlotte was too full-hearted for disguise, and they presently
      entered into a confidential cabal, that made her quite disturbed and
      provoked when hurried away. From this time, whenever they met, they were
      pretty much of a mind. &ldquo;I cannot see you,&rdquo; he always cried,
      &ldquo;without recurring to that painful subject&mdash;your sister&rsquo;s
      situation.&rdquo; He then broke forth in an animated offer of his own
      services to induce Dr. Burney to finish such a captivity, if he could
      flatter himself he might have any influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte eagerly promised him the greatest, and he gave her his promise
      to go to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      O What a noble Quixote! How much I feel obliged to him! How happy, when I
      may thank him!
    </p>
    <p>
      He then pondered upon ways and means. He had already sounded my father:
      &ldquo;but it is resolution,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;not inclination, Dr.
      Burney wants.&rdquo; After some further reflection, he then fixed upon a
      plan: &ldquo;I will set the Literary Club<a href="#linknote-338"
      name="linknoteref-338" id="linknoteref-338"><small>338</small></a> upon
      him!&rdquo; he cried: &ldquo;Miss Burney has some very true admirers
      there, and I am sure they will all eagerly assist. We will present him a
      petition&mdash;an address.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Much more passed: Mr. Windham expressed a degree of interest and kindness
      so cordial, that Charlotte says she quite longed to shake hands with him;
      and if any success ever accrues, she certainly must do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frightened, however, after she returned home, she feared our dearest
      father might unfairly be overpowered, and frankly wrote him a recital of
      the whole, counselling him to see Mr. Windham in private before a meeting
      at the club should take place.

    <h2>
      AN AMUSING INTERVIEW WITH MR. BOSWELL.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      And now for a scene a little surprising.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The beautiful chapel of St. George, repaired and finished by the best
      artists at an immense expense, which was now opened after a very long
      shutting up for its preparations, brought in-<span class="pagenum">377</span><a
      name="link377" id="link377"></a> numerable strangers to Windsor, and,
      among others, Mr. Boswell.
    </p>
    <p>
      This I heard, in my way to the chapel, from Mr. Turbulent, who overtook
      me, and mentioned having met Mr. Boswell at the Bishop of Carlisle&rsquo;s
      the evening, before. He proposed bringing him to call upon me; but this I
      declined, certain how little satisfaction would be given here by the
      entrance of a man so famous for compiling anecdotes. But yet I really
      wished to see him again, for old acquaintance sake, and unavoidable
      amusement from his oddity and good humour, as well as respect for the
      object of his constant admiration, my revered Dr. Johnson. I therefore
      told Mr. Turbulent I should be extremely glad to speak with him after the
      service was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, at the gate of the choir, Mr. Turbulent brought him to me. We
      saluted With mutual glee: his comic-serious face and manner have lost
      nothing of their wonted singularity nor yet have his mind and language, as
      you will soon confess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am extremely glad to see you indeed,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;but
      very sorry to see you here. My dear ma&rsquo;am, why do you stay?&mdash;it
      won&rsquo;t do, ma&rsquo;am! You must resign!&mdash;we can put up with it
      no longer. I told my good host the bishop so last night; we are all grown
      quite outrageous!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether I laughed the most, or stared the most, I am at a loss to say, but
      i hurried away from the cathedral, not to have such treasonable
      declarations overheard, for we were surrounded by a multitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accompanied me, however, not losing one moment in continuing his
      exhortations: &ldquo;If you do not quit, ma&rsquo;am, very soon, some
      violent measures, I assure you, will be taken. We shall address Dr. Burney
      in a body; I am ready to make the harangue myself. We shall fall upon him
      all at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped him to inquire about Sir Joshua; he said he saw him very often,
      and that his spirits were very good. I asked about Mr. Burke&rsquo;s book.<a
      href="#linknote-339" name="linknoteref-339" id="linknoteref-339"><small>339</small></a>
      &ldquo;O,&rdquo; cried he &ldquo;it Will come Out next week: &rsquo;tis
      the first book in the World, except my own, and that&rsquo;s coming out
      also very soon; only I want your help.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My help?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam,&mdash;you must give me some of your choice little notes
      of the doctor&rsquo;s; we have seen him long enough upon <span
      class="pagenum">378</span><a name="link378" id="link378"></a> stilts; I
      want to show him in a new light. Grave Sam, and great Sam, and solemn Sam,
      and learned Sam,&mdash;all these he has appeared over and over. Now I want
      to entwine a wreath of the graces across his brow; I want to show him as
      gay Sam, agreeable Sam, pleasant Sam; so you must help me with some of his
      beautiful billets to yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I evaded this by declaring I had not any stores at hand. He proposed a
      thousand curious expedients to get at them, but I was invincible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I was hurrying on, lest I should be too late. He followed eagerly,
      and again exclaimed, &ldquo;But, ma&rsquo;am, as I tell you, this won&rsquo;t
      do; you must resign off hand! Why, I would farm you out myself for double,
      treble the money! I wish I had the regulation of such a farm,&mdash;yet I
      am no farmer-general. But I should like to farm you, and so I will tell
      Dr. Burney. I mean to address him; I have a speech ready for the first
      opportunity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He then told me his &ldquo;Life of Dr. Johnson&rdquo; was nearly printed,
      and took a proof-sheet out of his pocket to show me; with crowds passing
      and repassing, knowing me well, and staring well at him: for we were now
      at the iron rails of the Queen&rsquo;s lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped; I could not ask him in: I saw he expected it, and was reduced
      to apologise, and tell him I must attend the queen immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      He uttered again stronger and stronger exhortations for my retreat,
      accompanied by expressions which I was obliged to check in their bud. But
      finding he had no chance for entering, he stopped me again at the gate,
      and said he would read me a part of his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no refusing this: and he began with a letter of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s
      to himself. He read it in strong imitation of the doctor&rsquo;s manner,
      very well, and not caricature. But Mrs. Schwellenberg was at her window, a
      crowd was gathering to stand round the rails, and the king and queen and
      royal family now approached from the Terrace. I made a rather quick
      apology, and, with a step as quick as my now weakened limbs have left in
      my power, I hurried to my apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may suppose I had inquiries enough, from all around, of &ldquo;Who was
      the gentleman I was talking to at the rails?&rdquo; And an injunction
      rather frank not to admit him beyond those limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I saw him again the next morning, in coming<span class="pagenum">379</span><a
      name="link379" id="link379"></a> from early prayers, and he again renewed
      his remonstrances, and his petition for my letters of Dr. Johnson. I
      cannot consent to print private letters, even of a man so justly
      celebrated, when addressed to myself: no, I shall hold sacred those
      revered and but too scarce testimonies of the high honour his kindness
      conferred upon me. One letter I have from him that is a masterpiece of
      elegance and kindness united. &lsquo;Twas his last.

    <h2>
      ILL, UNSETTLED, AND UNHAPPY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      November.&mdash;This month will be very brief of annals; I was so ill, so
      unsettled, so unhappy during every day, that I kept not a memorandum. All
      the short benefit I had received from the bark was now at an end: languor,
      feverish nights, and restless days were incessant. My memorial was always
      in my mind; my courage never rose to bringing it from my letter-case. Yet
      the war was over, the hope of a ship for my brother demolished, and my
      health required a change of life equally with my spirits and my happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen was all graciousness; and her favour and confidence and smiles
      redoubled my difficulties. I saw she had no suspicion but that I was hers
      for life; and, unimportant as I felt myself to her, in any comparison with
      those for whom I quitted her, I yet knew not how to give her the
      unpleasant surprise of a resignation for which I saw her wholly
      unprepared..
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true, my depression of spirits and extreme alteration of person
      might have operated as a preface; for I saw no one, except my royal
      mistress and Mrs. Schwellenberg, who noticed not the change, or who failed
      to pity and question me upon my health and my fatigues; but as they alone
      saw it not, or mentioned it not, that afforded me no resource. And thus,
      with daily intention to present my petition and conclude this struggle,
      night always returned with the effort unmade, and the watchful morning
      arose fresh to new purposes that seemed only formed for demolition. And
      the month expired as it began, with a desire the most strenuous of liberty
      and peace, combated by reluctance unconquerable to give pain, displeasure,
      or distress to my very gracious royal mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      December.-My loss of health was now so notorious, that no part of the
      house could wholly avoid acknowledging it; yet was the terrible picquet
      the catastrophe of every evening, <span class="pagenum">380</span><a
      name="link380" id="link380"></a> though frequent pains in my side forced
      me, three or four times in a game, to creep to my own room for hartshorn
      and for rest. And so weak and faint I was become, that I was compelled to
      put my head out into the air, at all hours, and in all weathers, from time
      to time, to recover the power of breathing, which seemed not seldom almost
      withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her majesty was very kind during this time, and the princesses interested
      themselves about me with a sweetness very grateful to me; indeed, the
      whole household showed compassion and regard, and a general opinion that I
      was falling into a decline ran through the establishment.... Thus there
      seemed about my little person a universal commotion; and it spread much
      farther, amongst those I have never or slightly mentioned. There seemed,
      indeed, but one opinion, that resignation of place or of life was the only
      remaining alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed now no time to be lost when I saw my dear father he
      recommended to me to be speedy, and my mother was very kind in urgency for
      immediate measures. I could not, however, summon courage to present my
      memorial; my heart always failed me, from seeing the queen&rsquo;s entire
      freedom from such an expectation: for though I was frequently so ill in
      her presence that I could hardly stand, I saw she concluded me, while life
      remained, inevitably hers.

    <h2>
      A MEDICAL OPINION ON MISS BURNEY&rsquo;S CONDITION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Finding my inability unconquerable, I at length determined upon consulting
      Mr. Francis. I wrote to Charlotte a faithful and Minute account of myself&rsquo;,
      with all my attacks&mdash;cough, pain In the side, weakness,
      sleeplessness, etc.,&mdash;at full length, and begged Mr. Francis&rsquo;s
      opinion how I must proceed. Very kindly he wrote directly to my father,
      exhorting instantaneous resignation, as all that stood before me to avert
      some dangerous malady.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dear Charlotte at the same time wrote to me conjuring my prompt
      retreat with the most affecting earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The uneasiness that preyed upon my spirits in a task so difficult to
      perform for myself, joined to my daily declension in health, was now so
      apparent, that, though I could go no farther, I paved the way for an
      opening, by owning to the queen that Mr. Francis had been consulted upon
      my health.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen now frequently inquired concerning his answer; <span
      class="pagenum">381</span><a name="link381" id="link381"></a> but as I
      knew he had written to my father, I deferred giving the result till I had
      had a final conference with that dear parent. I told her majesty my father
      would show me the letter when I saw him. This I saw raised for the first
      time a surmise that something was in agitation, though I am certain the
      suspicion did not exceed an expectation that leave would be requested for
      a short absence to recruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dearest father, all kindness and goodness, yet all alarm, thought time
      could never be more favourable; and when next I saw him at Chelsea, I
      wrote a second memorial to enclose the original one. With a beating heart,
      and every pulse throbbing, I returned thus armed to the Queen&rsquo;s
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schwellenberg sent for me to her room. I could hardly articulate a
      word to her. My agitation was so great that I was compelled to acknowledge
      something very awful was impending in my affairs, and to beg she would
      make no present inquiries. I had not meant to employ her in the business,
      nor to name it to her, but I was too much disturbed for concealment or
      evasion. She seemed really sorry, and behaved with a humanity I had not
      had much reason to expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent a terrible time till I went to the queen at night, spiriting
      myself up for my task, and yet finding apprehension gain ground every
      moment. Mrs. Schwellenberg had already been some time with her majesty
      when I was summoned. I am sure she had already mentioned the little she
      had gathered. I could hardly perform my customary offices from excess of
      trepidation. The queen looked at me with the most inquisitive solicitude.
      When left with her a moment I tried vainly to make an opening: I could
      not. She was too much impressed herself by my manner to wait long. She
      soon inquired what answer had arrived from Mr. Francis?
    </p>
    <p>
      That he could not, I said, prescribe at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hoped this would be understood, and said no more. The queen looked much
      perplexed, but made no answer.

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY BREAKS THE MATTER TO THE QUEEN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning I was half dead with real illness, excessive nervousness,
      and the struggle of what I had to force myself to perform. The queen again
      was struck with my appearance, which I believe indeed to have been
      shocking. When I was alone with her, she began upon Mr. Francis with more
      inquiry. I then tried to articulate that I had something of<span
      class="pagenum">382</span><a name="link382" id="link382"></a> deep
      consequence to myself to lay before her majesty; but that I was so unequal
      in my weakened state to speak it, that I had ventured to commit it to
      Writing, and entreated Permission to produce it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could hardly hear me, yet understood enough to give immediate consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then begged to know if I might present it-myself, or whether I should
      give it to Mrs. Schwellenberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, to me! to me!&rdquo; she cried, with kind eagerness. She added,
      however, not then; as she was going to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      This done was already some relief, terrible as was all that remained; but
      I now knew I must go on, and that all my fears and horrors were powerless
      to stop me.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a Drawing-room day. I saw the king at St. James&rsquo;s, and he
      made the most gracious inquiries about my health: so did each of the
      princesses. I found they were now all aware of its failure. The queen
      proposed to me to see Dr. Gisburne: the king seconded the proposition.
      There was no refusing; yet, just now, it was distressing to comply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, Friday, when again I was alone with the queen, she named
      the subject, and told me she would rather I should give the paper to the
      Schwellenberg, who had been lamenting to her my want of confidence in her,
      and saying I confided and told everything to the queen. &ldquo;I answered,&rdquo;
      continued her majesty, &ldquo;that you were always very good; but that,
      with regard to confiding, you seemed so happy with all your family, and to
      live so well together, that there was nothing to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I now perceived Mrs. Schwellenberg suspected some dissension at home was
      the cause of my depression. I was sorry not to deliver my memorial to the
      Principal person, and yet glad to have it to do where I felt so much less
      compunction in giving pain.

    <h2>
      THE MEMORIAL AND EXPLANATORY NOTE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I now desired an audience of Mrs. Schwellenberg. With what trembling
      agitation did I deliver her my paper, requesting her to have the goodness
      to lay it at the feet of the queen before her majesty left town! We were
      then to set out for Windsor before twelve o&rsquo;clock. Mrs.
      Schwellenberg herself remained in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here let me copy the memorial. <span class="pagenum">383</span><a
      name="link383" id="link383"></a> Most humbly presented to Her Majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, With the deepest sense of your Majesty&rsquo;s goodness and
      condescension, amounting even to sweetness&mdash;to kindness who can
      wonder I should never have been able to say what I know not how to write&mdash;that
      I find my strength and health unequal to my duty?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satisfied that I have regularly been spared and favoured by your
      Majesty&rsquo;s humane consideration to the utmost, I could never bring
      myself to the painful confession of my secret disquietude; but I have long
      felt creeping upon me a languor, a feebleness, that makes, at times, the
      most common attendance a degree of capital pain to me, and an exertion
      that I could scarce have made, but for the revived alacrity with which
      your Majesty&rsquo;s constant graciousness has inspired me, and would
      still, I believe, inspire me, even to my latest hour, while in your
      Majesty&rsquo;s immediate presence. I kept this to myself while I thought
      it might wear away,&mdash;or, at least, I only communicated it to obtain
      some medical advice: but the weakness, though it comes only in fits, has
      of late so much Increased, that I have hardly known how, many days, to
      keep myself about&mdash;or to rise up in the morning, or to stay up at
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At length, however, as my constitution itself seems slowly, yet
      surely, giving way, my father became alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not enter, here, upon his mortification and disappointment:
      the health and preservation of his daughter could alone be more precious
      to him than your Majesty&rsquo;s protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my own feelings upon the subject it would ill become me to
      detain your Majesty, and the less, as I am fully sensible my place, in
      point of its real business, may easily he far better supplied;&mdash;In
      point of sincere devotion to your majesty, I do not so readily yield. I
      can only, therefore, most humbly entreat that your Majesty will deign to
      accept from my father and myself the most dutiful acknowledgments for the
      uniform benignity so graciously shown to me during the whole of my
      attendance. My father had originally been apprehensive of my inability,
      with regard to strength, for sustaining any but the indulgence of a
      domestic life: but your Majesty&rsquo;s justice and liberality will make
      every allowance for the flattered feelings of a parent&rsquo;s heart,
      which could not endure, untried, to relinquish for his daughter so high an
      honour as a personal office about your Majesty. <span class="pagenum">384</span><a
      name="link384" id="link384"></a> I dare not, Madam, presume to hope that
      Your Majesty&rsquo;s condescension will reach to the smallest degree of
      concern at parting with me; but permit me, Madam, humbly, earnestly, and
      fervently, to solicit that I may not be deprived of the mental benevolence
      of your Majesty, which so thankfully I have experienced, and so gratefully
      must for ever remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That every blessing, every good, may light upon your Majesties
      here, and await a future and happier period hereafter, will be always
      amongst the first prayers of,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, your Majesty&rsquo;s ever devoted, ever grateful, most
      attached, and most dutiful subject and servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frances Burney.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, though written so long ago, I only wrote an explanatory note to
      accompany it, which I will also copy:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I yet humbly presume to entreat your Majesty&rsquo;s patience
      for a few added lines, to say that the address which I now most
      respectfully lay at your Majesty&rsquo;s feet was drawn up two months ago,
      when first I felt so extreme a weakness as to render the smallest exertion
      a fatigue? While I waited, however, for firmness to present it, I took the
      bark, and found myself, for some time, so much amended, that I put it
      aside, and my father, perceiving me better, lost his anxious uneasiness
      for my trying a new mode of life. But the good effect has, of late, so
      wholly failed, that an entire change of air and manner of living are
      strongly recommended as the best chance for restoring my shattered health.
      We hold it, therefore, a point of that grateful duty we owe to your
      Majesty&rsquo;s goodness and graciousness, to make this melancholy
      statement at once, rather than to stay till absolute incapacity might
      disable me from offering one small but sincere tribute of profound respect
      to your Majesty,&mdash;the only one in my power&mdash;that of continuing
      the high honour of attending your Majesty, till your Majesty&rsquo;s own
      choice, time, and convenience nominate a successor.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE KEEPER OF THE ROBES&rsquo; CONSTERNATION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schwellenberg took the memorial, and promised me her services, but
      desired to know its contents. I begged vainly to be excused speaking them.
      She persisted, and I then was compelled to own they contained my
      resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      How aghast she looked!&mdash;how inflamed with wrath!&mdash;how<span
      class="pagenum">385</span><a name="link385" id="link385"></a> petrified
      with astonishment! It was truly a dreadful moment to me. She expostulated
      on such a step, as if it led to destruction, she offered to save me from
      it, as if the peace of my life depended on averting it and she menaced me
      with its bad consequences, as it life itself, removed from these walls,
      would become an evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      I plainly recapitulated the suffering state in which I had lived for the
      last three months; the difficulty with which I had waded through even the
      most common fatigues of the day; the constraint of attendance, however
      honourable, to an invalid; and the impracticability of pursuing such a
      life, when thus enfeebled, with the smallest chance of ever recovering the
      health and strength which it had demolished.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all this she began a vehement eulogium on the superior happiness and
      blessing of my lot, while under such a protection; and angrily exhorted me
      not to forfeit what I could never regain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then frankly begged her to forbear SO painful a discussion, and told her
      that the memorial was from my father as well as myself&mdash;that I had no
      right or authority to hesitate in delivering it&mdash;that the queen
      herself was prepared to expect it&mdash;and that I had promised my father
      not to go again to Windsor till it was presented. I entreated her,
      therefore, to have the goodness to show it at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was unanswerable, and she left me with the paper in her hand, slowly
      conveying it to its place of destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as she was gone, I was called to Dr. Gisburne or, rather, without
      being called, I found him in my room, as I returned to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think if my mind, now, wanted not medicine the most I told him, however,
      my corporeal complaints and he ordered me opium and three glasses of wine
      in the day, and recommended rest to me, and an application to retire to my
      friends for some weeks, as freedom from anxiety was as necessary to my
      restoration as freedom from attendance.

    <h2>
      LEAVE OF ABSENCE IS SUGGESTED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During this consultation I was called to Mrs. Schwellenberg. Do you think
      I breathed as I went along?&mdash;No! She received me, nevertheless, with
      complacency and smiles; she began a laboured panegyric of her own friendly
      zeal and goodness, and then said she had a proposal to make to me, which
      she <span class="pagenum">386</span><a name="link386" id="link386"></a>considered
      as the most fortunate turn my affairs could take, and a a proof that I
      should find her the best friend I had in the world. She then premised that
      she had shown the paper,&mdash;that the queen had read it, and said it was
      very modest, and nothing improper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her proposal was, that I should have leave of absence for six weeks, to go
      about and change the air, to Chelsea, and Norbury Park, and Capitan
      Phillips, and Mr. Francis, and Mr. Cambrick, which would get me quite
      well; and, during that time, she would engage Mlle. Montmoulin to perform
      my office.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was much disturbed at this; and though rejoiced and relieved to
      understand that the queen had read my memorial without displeasure, I was
      grieved to see it was not regarded as final. I only replied I would
      communicate her plan to my father. Soon after this we set out for Windsor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the first presenting myself before the queen was a task the heaviest,
      if possible, of any. Yet I was ill enough, heaven knows, to carry the
      apology of my retreat in my countenance. However, it was a terrible
      effort. I could hardly enter her room. She spoke at once, and with
      infinite softness, asking me how I did after my journey? &ldquo;Not well,
      indeed,&rdquo; I simply answered. &ldquo;But better?&rdquo; she cried;
      &ldquo;are you not a little better?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I only shook my head; I believe the rest of my frame shook without my aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! not a little?&mdash;not a little bit better?&rdquo; she
      cried, in the most soothing voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I did indeed not expect
      to be better.&rdquo; I then muttered something indistinctly enough, of the
      pain I had suffered in what I had done: she opened, however, upon another
      subject immediately, and no more was said upon this. But she was kind, and
      sweet, and gentle, and all consideration with respect to my attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote the proposal to my poor father, I received by return of post, the
      most truly tender letter he ever wrote me. He returns thanks for the
      clemency With which my melancholy memorial has been received, and is truly
      sensible of the high honour shown me In the new proposition; but he sees
      my health so impaired, my strength so decayed, my whole frame so nearly
      demolished, that he apprehends anything short of a permanent resignation,
      that would ensure lasting rest and recruit, might prove fatal. He quotes a
      letter from Mr. Francis, <span class="pagenum">387</span><a name="link387"
      id="link387"></a> containing his opinion that I must even be speedy in my
      retiring or risk the utmost danger and he finishes a letter filled with
      gratitude towards the queen and affection to his daughter, with his
      decisive opinion that I cannot go on, and his prayers and blessings on my
      retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term &ldquo;speedy,&rdquo; in Mr. Francis&rsquo;s opinion, deterred me
      from producing this letter, as it seemed indelicate and unfair to hurry
      the queen, after offering her the fullest time. I therefore waited till
      Mrs. Schwellenberg came to Windsor before I made any report of my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scene almost horrible ensued, when I told Cerbera the offer was
      declined. She was too much enraged for disguise, and uttered the most
      furious expressions of indignant contempt at our proceedings. I am sure
      she would gladly have confined us both in the Bastille, had England such a
      misery, as a fit place to bring us to ourselves, from a daring so
      outrageous against imperial wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Fanny Burney to Dr. Burney) January, 1791-......I thank heaven, there was
      much softness in the manner of naming you this morning. I see no ill-will
      mixed with the reluctance, which much consoles me. I do what is possible
      to avoid all discussion; I see its danger still so glaring. How could I
      resist, should the queen condescend to desire, to ask, that I would yet
      try another year?&mdash;and another year would but be uselessly
      demolishing me; for never could I explain to her that a situation which
      unavoidably casts all my leisure into the presence of Mrs. Schwellenberg
      must necessarily be subversive of my health, because incompatible with my
      peace, my ease, my freedom, my spirits, and my affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen is probably kept from any suspicion Of the true nature of the
      case, by the praises of Mrs. Schwellenberg, who, with all her asperity and
      persecution, is uncommonly partial to my society; because, in order to
      relieve myself from sullen gloom, or apparent dependency, I generally make
      my best exertions to appear gay and chatty; for when I can do this, she
      forbears both rudeness and imperiousness. She then, I have reason to
      believe, says to the queen, as I know She does to some others, &ldquo;The
      Bernan bin reely agribble&rdquo;; and the queen, not knowing the
      incitement that forces my elaborate and painful efforts, may suppose I am
      lively at heart, when she hears I am so in discourse. And there is no
      developing this without giving the queen the severest embarrassment as
      well as chagrin. <span class="pagenum">388</span><a name="link388"
      id="link388"></a> I would not turn Informer for the world. Mrs.
      Schwellenberg too, with all her faults, is heart and soul devoted to her
      roil mistress, with the truest faith and loyalty. I hold, therefore,
      silence on this subject to be a sacred duty. To return to you, my dearest
      padre, is the only road that has open for my return to strength and
      comfort, bodily and mental. I&rsquo;m inexpressibly grateful to the queen,
      but I burn to be delivered from Mrs. Schwellenberg, and I pine to be again
      in the arms of my padre.

      A ROYAL GIFT TO THE MASTER OF THE HORSE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      What will you give me, fair ladies, for a copy of verse, written between
      the Queen of Great Britain and your most small little journalist?
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning of the ball the queen sent for me, and said she had a fine
      pair of old-fashioned gloves, white, with stiff tops and a deep gold
      fringe, which she meant to send to her new master of the horse, Lord
      Harcourt, who was to be at the dance. She wished to convey them in a copy
      of verses, of which she had composed three lines, but could not get on.
      She told me her ideas, and I had the honour to help her in the metre and
      now I have the honour to copy them from her own royal hand:&mdash;
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;TO THE EARL OF HARCOURT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, happy gloves, bedeck Earl Harcourt&rsquo;s hand, And let him
      know they come from fairy-land, Where ancient customs still retain their
      reign; To modernize them all attempts were vain. Go, cries Queen Mab, some
      noble owner seek, Who has a proper taste for the antique.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, no criticising, fair ladies!-the assistant was neither allowed a pen
      nor a moment, but called upon to help finish, as she might have been to
      hand a fan. The earl, you may suppose, was sufficiently enchanted.

    <h2>
      CONFERENCES WITH THE QUEEN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      April.-In the course of this month I had two conferences with my royal
      mistress upon my resignation, in which I spoke with all possible openness
      upon its necessity. She condescended to speak very honourably of my dear
      father to me,&mdash;and, in a long discourse upon my altered health with
      Mrs. de <span class="pagenum">389</span><a name="link389" id="link389"></a>
      Luc, she still further condescended to speak most graciously of his
      daughter, saying in particular, these strong words, in answer to something
      kind uttered by that good friend in my favour. &ldquo;O, as to character,
      she is what we call in German &lsquo;true as gold&rsquo; and, in point of
      heart, there is not, all the world over, one better&rdquo;&mdash;and added
      something further upon sincerity very forcibly. This makes me very happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She deigned, also, in one of these conferences, to consult with me openly
      upon my successor, stating her difficulties, and making me enumerate
      various requisites. It would be dangerous, she said, to build upon meeting
      in England with one who would be discreet in point of keeping off friends
      and acquaintances from frequenting the palace; and she graciously implied
      much commendation of my discretion, in her statement of what she feared
      from a new person.
    </p>
    <p>
      May.-As no notice whatever was taken, all this time, of my successor, or
      my retirement, after very great harass of suspense, and sundry attempts to
      conquer it, I had at length again a conference with my royal mistress. She
      was evidently displeased at again being called upon, but I took the
      courage to openly remind her that the birthday was her majesty&rsquo;s own
      time, and that my father conceived it to be the period of my attendance by
      her especial appointment. And this was a truth which flashed its own
      conviction on her recollection. She paused, and then, assentingly, said,
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; I then added, that as, after the birthday, their
      majesties went to Windsor, and the early prayers began immediately, I must
      needs confess I felt myself wholly unequal to encountering the fatigue of
      rising for them in my present weakened state. She was now very gracious
      again, conscious all this was fair and true. She told me her own
      embarrassments concerning the successor, spoke confidentially of her
      reasons for not engaging an Englishwoman, and acknowledged a person was
      fixed upon, though something yet remained unarranged. She gave me,
      however, to understand that all would be expedited: and foreign letters
      were despatched, I know, immediately.

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY DETERMINES ON SECLUSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      From Sunday, May 15 to May 22.&mdash;The trial of the poor persecuted Mr.
      Hastings being now again debating and arranging for continuance, all our
      house, I found, expected me now to come forth, and my royal mistress and
      Mrs. Schwellenberg<span class="pagenum">390</span><a name="link390"
      id="link390"></a> thought I should find it irresistible, indeed it nearly
      was so, from my anxious interest in the approaching defence; but when I
      considered the rumours likely to be raised after my retreat, by those
      terrifying watchers of Court transactions who inform the public of their
      conjectures, I dreaded the probable assertion that I must needs be
      disgusted or discontented, for health could not be the true motive of my
      resignation, since I was in public just before it took place. I feared,
      too, that even those who promoted the enterprise might reproach me with my
      ability to do what I wished. These considerations determined me to run no
      voluntary risks especially as I should so ill know how to parry Mr.
      Windham, should he now attack me upon a subject concerning which he merits
      thanks so nobly, that I am satisfied my next interview with him must draw
      them forth from me. Justice, satisfaction in his exertions, and gratitude
      for their spirited willingness, all call upon me to give him that poor
      return. The danger of it, however, now, is too great to be tried, if
      avoidable: and I had far rather avoid seeing him, than either gratify
      myself by expressing my sense of his kindness, or unjustly withhold from
      him what I think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      These considerations determined me upon relinquishing all public places,
      and all private visits, for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial, however, was delayed, and the Handelian Commemoration came on.
      My beloved Mr. and Mrs. Locke will have told my Susan my difficulties in
      this business, and I will now tell all three how they ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen, unexpectedly, having given me a ticket, and enjoined me to go
      the first day, that I might have longer time to recruit against the king&rsquo;s
      birthday, I became, as you will have heard, much distressed what course to
      pursue.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the first moment I was alone with her majesty to express my father&rsquo;s
      obligation to her for not suffering me to sit up on her own birthday, in
      this week, and I besought her permission to lay before her my father&rsquo;s
      motives for hitherto wishing me to keep quiet this spring, as well as my
      own, adding I was sure her majesty would benignly wish this business to be
      done as peaceably and unobserved as possible. She looked extremely
      earnest, and bid me proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then briefly stated that whoever had the high honour of belonging to
      their majesties were liable to comments upon all their actions, that, if
      the comment was only founded in truth, we had nothing to fear, but that,
      as the world was much less <span class="pagenum">391</span><a
      name="link391" id="link391"></a> addicted to veracity, than to mischief,
      my father and myself had an equal apprehension that, if I should now be
      seen in public so quickly before the impending change, reports might be
      spread, as soon as I went home, that it could not be for health I
      resigned. She listened very attentively and graciously, and instantly,
      acquiesced.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the trial actually recommenced, the queen grew anxious for my going
      to it: she condescended to intimate that my accounts of it were the most
      faithful and satisfactory she received, and to express much Ill-will to
      giving them up. The motives I had mentioned, however, were not merely
      personal she could not but see any comments must involve more than myself,
      and therefore I abided steadily by her first agreement to my absenting
      myself from all public places, and only gently joined in her regret, which
      I forcibly enough felt in this instance, Without venturing any offer of
      relinquishing the prudential plan previously arranged. She gave me tickets
      for Charles for every day that the hall was opened, and I collected what I
      could of information from him for her satisfaction.

      THE HASTINGS TRIAL RESUMED: &lsquo;THE ACCUSED MAKES HIS DEFENCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Queen&rsquo;s House, London, June.-the opening of this month her majesty
      told me that the next day Mr. Hastings was to make his defence, and warmly
      added, &ldquo;I would give the world you could go to it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an expression so unusual in animation, that I instantly told her
      I would write to my father, who could not possibly, in that case,
      hesitate.

      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you may wrap up, so as not to
      catch cold that once?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her majesty that, as my father had never thought going out would be
      really prejudicial to my health, he had only wished to have his motive
      laid fairly before her majesty, and then to leave it to her own command.
      Her majesty accepted this mode of consent, and gave me tickets for Charles
      and Sarah to accompany me, and gave leave and another ticket for Mr. de
      Luc to be of the party. Thursday, June 2.&mdash;I went once more to
      Westminster Hall. Charles and Sarah came not to their time, and I left
      directions and tickets, and set off with only Mr. de Luc, to secure our<span
      class="pagenum">392</span><a name="link392" id="link392"></a> own, and
      keep places for them. The Hall was more crowded than on any day since the
      trial commenced, except the first. Peers, commoners, and counsel,
      peeresses, commoneresses, and the numerous indefinites crowded every part,
      with a just and fair curiosity to hear one day&rsquo;s defence, after
      seventy-three of accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately I sat too high up to hear the opening, and when, afterwards,
      the departure of some of my obstacles removed me lower, I was just behind
      some of those unfeeling enemies who have not even the decorum due to
      themselves, of appearing to listen to what is offered against their own
      side. I could only make out that this great and persecuted man upon a plan
      all his own, and at a risk impossible to ascertain, was formally making
      his own defence, not with retaliating declamation, but by a simple,
      concise, and most interesting statement of facts, and of the necessities
      accompanying them in the situation to which the House then impeaching had
      five times called him. He spoke with most gentlemanly temper of his
      accusers, his provocation considered, yet with a firmness of disdain of
      the injustice with which he had been treated in return for his services,
      that was striking and affecting, though unadorned and manly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His spirit, however, and the injuries which raised it, rested not quietly
      upon his particular accusers: he arraigned the late minister, Lord North,
      of ingratitude and double-dealing, and the present minister, Mr. Pitt, of
      unjustifiably and unworthily forbearing to sustain him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Fox, artfully enough, interrupted to say the king&rsquo;s
      ministers were not to be arraigned for what passed in the House of
      Parliament. Mr. Burke arose also to enter his protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Hastings then lost his patience and his temper: he would not
      suffer the interruption; he had never, he said, interrupted their long
      speeches; and when Mr. Burke again attempted to speak, Mr. Hastings, in an
      impassioned but affecting manner, extended his arms, and called out
      loudly, &ldquo;I throw myself upon the protection of your lordships:&mdash;I
      am not used to public speaking, and cannot answer them. What I wish to
      submit to your lordships I have committed to paper; but, if I am punished
      for what I say, I must insist upon being heard&mdash;I call upon you, my
      lords, to protect me from this violence!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This animated appeal prevailed; the managers were silenced by an almost
      universal cry of &ldquo;Hear, hear, hear!&rdquo; from the <span
      class="pagenum">393</span><a name="link393" id="link393"></a> lords; and
      by Lord Kenyon, who represented the chancellor, and said, &ldquo;Mr.
      Hastings, proceed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The angry orators, though with a very ill grace, were then silenced. They
      were little aware what a compliment this intemperate eagerness was paying
      to Mr. Hastings, who for so many long days manifested that fortitude
      against attack, and that patience against abuse, which they could not
      muster, Without any parallel in provocation, even for three short hours. I
      rejoiced with all my heart to find Mr. Windham was not in their box. He
      did not enter with them in procession, nor appear as a manager or party
      concerned, further than as a member of the House of Commons. I could not
      distinguish him in so large a group, and he either saw not, or knew not,
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion of the defence I heard better, as Mr. Hastings spoke
      considerably louder from this time; the spirit of indignation animated his
      manner and gave strength to his voice. You will have seen the chief parts
      of his discourse In the newspapers and you cannot, I think, but grow more
      and more his friend as you peruse it. He called pathetically and solemnly
      for instant judgment; but the Lords, after an adjournment decided to hear
      his defence by evidence, and order, the next sessions. How grievous such
      continual delay to a man past sixty, and sighing for such a length of time
      for redress from a prosecution as yet unparalleled in our annals.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was over, Colonel Manners came round to speak to-me and talk over
      the defence. He is warmly for Mr. Hastings. He inquired about Windsor; I
      should have made him stare a little had I told him I never expected to see
      him there again.

    <h2>
      MR. WINDHAM IS CONGRATULATED ON HIS SILENCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When he came down-stairs into the large waiting-hall, Mr. de Luc went in
      search of William and chairs. Sally then immediately discerned Mr. Windham
      with some ladies. He looked at me without at first knowing me.... Sarah
      whispered me Mr. Windham was looking harder and harder; and presently he
      came up to me, and in a tone of very deep concern, and with a look that
      fully concurred with &lsquo;it, he said, &ldquo;Do I see Miss Burney?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not but feel the extent of the interrogation, and my assent
      acknowledged my comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I was going to make a speech&mdash;not
      Very gallant!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">394</span><a name="link394"
      id="link394"></a>, &ldquo;But it is what I should like better,&rdquo; I
      cried, &ldquo;for it is kind if you were going to say I look miserably
      ill, as that is but a necessary consequence of feeling so,&mdash;and
      miserably ill enough I have felt this long time past.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He would not allow quite that, he said; but I flew from the subject, to
      tell him I had been made very happy by him. HE gave me one of his starts,&mdash;but
      immediately concluded it was by no good, and therefore would not speak in
      inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I did not see you in the box,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;and I had
      been very much afraid I should have seen you there. But now my fears are
      completely over, and you have made me completely happy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He protested, with a comic but reproachful smile, he knew not how to be
      glad, if it was still only in the support of a bad cause, and if still I
      really supported it. And then he added he had gone amongst the House of
      Commons instead of joining the managers, because that enabled him to give
      his place to a friend, who was not a member.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be sure,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you would see me here
      to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had always threatened him with giving fairest play to the defence, and
      always owned I had been most afraid Of his harangue; therefore to find the
      charges end without his making it saved me certainly a shake,&mdash;either
      for Mr. Hastings or himself,&mdash;for one of them must thenceforth have
      fallen in my estimation. I believe, however, this was a rather delicate
      point, as he made me no answer, but a grave smile; but I am sure he
      instantly understood his relinquishing his intended charge was my subject
      of exultation. And, to make it plainer, I then added, &ldquo;I am really
      very generous to be thus made happy, considering how great has been my
      curiosity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, to have gratified that curiosity,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;would
      have been no very particular inducement with me; though I have no right to
      take it for a compliment, as there are two species of curiosity,&mdash;yours,
      therefore, you leave wholly ambiguous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I am content with that,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;so long as I am
      gratified, I give you leave to take it which way you please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He murmured something I could not distinctly hear, of concern at my
      continued opinion upon this subject; but I do not think, by his manner, it
      much surprised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;why, as well as what, I feared&mdash;that
      fatal candour, of which so long ago you warned me to beware<span
      class="pagenum">395</span><a name="link395" id="link395"></a> to the very
      last moment. And, indeed, I was kept in alarm, for at every figure I saw
      start up, just now,&mdash;Mr. Fox, Mr. Burke, Mr. Grey,&mdash;I concluded
      yours would be the next.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were prepared, then,&rdquo; cried he, with no little malice,
      &ldquo;for a voice issuing from a distant pew."<a href="#linknote-340"
      name="linknoteref-340" id="linknoteref-340"><small>340</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss BURNEY MAKES HER REPORT.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we came home I was immediately summoned to her majesty, to whom I
      gave a full and fair account of all I had heard of the defence; and it
      drew tears from her expressive eyes as I repeated Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s own
      words, upon the hardship and injustice of the treatment he had sustained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, at night, the king called upon me to repeat my account and I
      was equally faithful, sparing nothing of what had dropped from the
      persecuted defendant relative to his majesty&rsquo;s ministers. I thought
      official accounts might be less detailed there than against the managers,
      who, as open enemies, excite not so much my &ldquo;high displeasure&rdquo;
      as the friends of government, who so insidiously elected and panegyrised
      him while they wanted his assistance, and betrayed and deserted him when
      he was no longer in a capacity to serve them. Such, at least, is the light
      in which the defence places them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king listened with much earnestness and a marked compassion. He had
      already read the account sent him officially, but he was as eager to hear
      all I could recollect, as if still uninformed of what had passed. The
      words may be given to the eye, but the impression they make can only be
      conveyed by the ear; and I came back so eagerly interested, that my memory
      was not more stored with the very words than my voice with the intonations
      of all that had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to My bearing this sole unofficial exertion since my illness,
      I can only say the fatigue I felt bore not any parallel with that of every
      Drawing&mdash;room day, because I was seated.

    <h2>
      PRINCE WILLIAM INSISTS ON THE KING&rsquo;S HEALTH BEING DRUNK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      June 4.&mdash;Let me now come to the 4th, the last birthday of the good,
      gracious, benevolent king I shall ever, in all human probability, pass
      under his royal roof.<span class="pagenum">396</span><a name="link396"
      id="link396"></a> The thought was affecting to me, in defiance of MY
      volunteer conduct, and I could scarce speak to the queen when I first went
      to her, and wished to say something upon a day So interesting. The king
      was most gracious and kind when he came into the state dressing-room at
      St. James&rsquo;s, and particularly inquired about my health and strength,
      and if they would befriend me for the day. I longed again to tell him how
      hard I would work them, rather than let them, on such a day, drive me from
      my office; but I found it better suited me to be quiet; It was safer not
      to trust to any expression of loyalty, with a mind so full, and on a day
      so critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner Mrs. Schwellenberg presided, attired magnificently. Miss
      Goldsworthy, Mrs. Stainforth, Messrs. de Luc and Stanhope dined with us;
      and, while we were still eating fruit, the Duke of Clarence entered. He
      was just risen from the king&rsquo;s table, and waiting for his equipage
      to go home and prepare for the ball. To give you an idea of the energy of
      his royal highness&rsquo;s language, I ought to set apart a &ldquo;general
      objection&rdquo; to writing, or rather intimating, certain forcible words,
      and beg leave to show you, in genuine colours, a royal sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all rose, of course, upon his entrance, and the two gentlemen placed
      themselves behind their chairs while the footmen left the room; but he
      ordered us all to sit down, and called the men back to hand about some
      wine. He was in exceeding high spirits and in the utmost good humour. He
      placed himself at the head of the table, next Mrs. Schwellenberg, and
      looked remarkably well, gay, and full of sport and mischief, yet clever
      withal as well as comical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is the first day I have ever dined with the king at St.
      James&rsquo;s on his birthday. Pray, have you all drunk his majesty&rsquo;s
      health?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, your roy&rsquo;l highness: your roy&rsquo;l highness might make
      dem do dat,&rdquo; said Mrs. Schwellenberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, by &mdash;&mdash; will I! Here, you (to the footman), bring
      champagne! I&rsquo;ll drink the king&rsquo;s health again, if I die for
      it. Yet, I have done pretty well already: so has the king, I promise you!
      I believe his majesty was never taken such good care of before. We have
      kept his spirits up, I promise you: we have enabled him to go through his
      fatigues; and I should have done more still, but for the ball and Mary&mdash;I
      have promised to dance with Mary!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Princess Mary made her first appearance at Court to-day She looked most
      interesting and unaffectedly lovely she is a <span class="pagenum">397</span><a
      name="link397" id="link397"></a>, sweet creature, and perhaps, in point of
      beauty, the first of this truly beautiful race, of which Princess Mary may
      be called pendant to the Prince of Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      Champagne being now brought for the duke, he ordered it all round. When it
      came to me I whispered to Westerhaults to carry it on: the duke slapped
      his hand violently on the table, and called out, &ldquo;O, by&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      you shall drink it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no resisting this. We all stood up, and the duke sonorously gave
      the royal toast. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; cried he, making us all sit down
      again, &ldquo;where are my rascals of servants? I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be
      in time for the ball; besides, I&rsquo;ve got a deuced tailor waiting to
      fix on my epaulette! Here, you, go and see for my servants! d&rsquo;ye
      hear? Scamper off!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Off ran William.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s have the king&rsquo;s health again. De Luc, drink
      it. Here, champagne to De Luc!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish you could have seen Mr. de Luc&rsquo;s mixed simper half pleased,
      half alarmed. However, the wine came and he drank it, the duke taking a
      bumper for himself at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Stanhope!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;Stanhope shall have a glass
      too. Here, champagne! what are you all about? Why don&rsquo;t <i>you</i>
      give champagne to poor Stanhope?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stanhope, with great pleasure, complied, and the duke again
      accompanied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come hither, do you hear?&rdquo; cried the duke to the servants;
      and on the approach, slow and submissive, of Mrs. Stainforth&rsquo;s man,
      he hit him a violent slap on the back, calling out, &ldquo;Hang you! why
      don&rsquo;t you see for my rascals?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Away flew the man, and then he called out to Westerhaults, &ldquo;Hark&rsquo;ee!
      bring another glass of champagne to Mr. de Luc!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. de Luc knows these royal youths too well to venture at so vain an
      experiment as disputing with them, so he only shrugged his shoulders and
      drank the wine. The duke did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, poor Stanhope,&rdquo; cried the duke, &ldquo;give another
      glass to poor Stanhope, d&rsquo;ye hear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not your royal highness afraid,&rdquo; cried Mr. Stanhope,
      displaying the full circle of his borrowed teeth, &ldquo;I shall be apt to
      be rather up in the world, as the folks say, if I tope on at this rate?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all! you can&rsquo;t get drunk in a better cause, I&rsquo;d
      get <span class="pagenum">398</span><a name="link398" id="link398"></a>
      drunk myself&rsquo; if it was not for the ball. Here, champagne! another
      glass for the philosopher! I keep sober for Mary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, your royal highness,&rdquo; cried Mr. de Luc, gaining courage as
      he drank, &ldquo;you will make me quite droll of it if you make me go on,&mdash;quite
      droll!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better! so much the better! it will do you a monstrous
      deal of good. Here, another glass of champagne for the queen&rsquo;s
      philosopher!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. de Luc obeyed, and the duke then addressed Mrs. Schwellenberg&rsquo;s
      George. &ldquo;Here! you! you! why, where is my carriage? run and see, do
      you hear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Off hurried George, grinning irrepressibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was not for that deuced tailor, I would not stir. I shall
      dine at the Queen&rsquo;s house on Monday, Miss Goldsworthy; I shall come
      to dine with the princess royal. I find she does not go to Windsor with
      the queen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen meant to spend one day at Windsor, on account of a review which
      carried the king that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some talk then ensued upon the duke&rsquo;s new carriage, which they all
      agreed to be the most beautiful that day, at court. I had not seen it,
      which, to me, was some impediment against praising it.

    <h2>
      THE QUEEN&rsquo;s HEALTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      He then said it was necessary to drink the queens health. The gentlemen
      here made no demur, though Mr. de Luc arched his eyebrows in expressive
      fear of consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bumper,&rdquo; cried the duke, &ldquo;to the queen&rsquo;s
      gentleman-usher.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They all stood up and drank the queen&rsquo;s health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are three of us,&rdquo; cried the duke, &ldquo;all belonging
      to the queen: the queen&rsquo;s philosopher, the queen&rsquo;s gentleman
      usher, and the queen&rsquo;s son; but, thank heaven, I&rsquo;m the
      nearest!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried Mr. Stanhope, a little affronted, &ldquo;I am not
      now the queen&rsquo;s gentleman-usher; I am the queen&rsquo;s equerry,
      sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A glass more of champagne here! What are you all so slow for? Where
      are all my rascals gone? They&rsquo;ve put me in one passion already this
      morning. Come, a glass of champagne for the queen&rsquo;s gentleman-usher!&rdquo;
      laughing heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Stanhope; &ldquo;I am equerry, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And another glass to the queen&rsquo;s philosopher!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither gentleman objected; but Mrs. Schwellenberg, who <span
      class="pagenum">399</span><a name="link399" id="link399"></a> had sat
      laughing and happy all this time, now grew alarmed, and said, &ldquo;Your
      royal highness, I am afraid for the ball!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your potato-jaw, my dear,&rdquo; cried the duke, patting her&mdash;but,
      recollecting himself, he took her hand and pretty abruptly kissed it, and
      then, flinging it away hastily, laughed aloud, and called out, &ldquo;There,
      that will make amends for anything, so now I may say what I will. So here!
      a glass of champagne for the queen&rsquo;s philosopher and the queen&rsquo;s
      gentleman-usher! Hang me if it will not do them a monstrous deal of good!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here news was brought that the equipage was in order. He started up,
      calling out, &ldquo;Now, then, for my deuced tailor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, your royal highness,&rdquo; cried Mr. de Luc, in a tone of
      expostulation, &ldquo;now you have made us droll, you go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Off! however, he went. And is it not a curious scene? All my amaze is, how
      any of their heads bore such libations.

    <h2>
      THE PROCESSION TO THE BALL-ROOM: ABSENCE OF THE PRINCES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the evening I had by no means strength to encounter the ball-room. I
      gave my tickets to Mrs. and Miss Douglas. Mrs. Stainforth was dying to see
      the Princess Mary in her Court dress. Mr. Stanhope offered to conduct her
      to a place of prospect. She went with him. I thought this preferable to an
      unbroken evening with my fair companion, and Mr. de Luc, thinking the
      same, we both left Mrs. Schwellenberg to unattire, and followed. But we
      were rather in a scrape by trusting to Mr. Stanhope after all this
      champagne: he had carried Mrs. Stainforth to the very door of the
      ball-room, and there fixed her&mdash;in a place which the king, queen, and
      suite must brush past in order to enter the ball-room. I had followed,
      however, and the crowds of beef-eaters, officers, and guards that lined
      all the state-rooms through which we exhibited ourselves, prevented my
      retreating alone. I stood, therefore, next to Mrs. Stainforth, and saw the
      ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passage was made so narrow by attendants, that they were all forced to
      go one by one. First, all the king&rsquo;s great state-officers, amongst
      whom I recognised Lord Courtown, a treasurer of the household; Lord
      Salisbury carried a candle!&mdash;&rsquo;tis an odd etiquette.&mdash;These
      being passed, came the king&mdash;he saw us and laughed; then the queen&rsquo;s
      master of the horse, Lord Harcourt, who did ditto; then some more. <span
      class="pagenum">400</span><a name="link400" id="link400"></a> The
      vice-chamberlain carries the queen&rsquo;s candle, that she may have the
      arm of the lord chamberlain to lean on; accordingly, Lord Aylesbury,
      receiving that honour, now preceded the queen: she looked amazed at sight
      of us. The kind princesses one by one acknowledged us. I spoke to sweet
      Princess Mary, wishing her royal highness joy: she looked in a delight and
      an alarm nearly equal. She was to dance her first minuet. Then followed
      the ladies of the bedchamber, and Lady Harcourt was particularly civil.
      Then the maids of honour, every one of whom knew and spoke to us. I peered
      vainly for the Duke of Clarence, but none of the princes passed us.<a
      href="#linknote-341" name="linknoteref-341" id="linknoteref-341"><small>341</small></a>
      What a crowd brought up the rear! I was vexed not to see the Prince of
      Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, God bless the king! and many and many such days may he know!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was now so tired as to be eager to go back; but the queen&rsquo;s
      philosopher, the good and most sober and temperate of men, was really a
      little giddy with all his bumpers, and his eyes, which were quite
      lustrous, could not fix any object steadily; while the poor
      gentleman-usher&mdash;equerry, I mean&mdash;kept his Mouth so wide open
      with one continued grin,-I suppose from the sparkling beverage,&mdash;that
      I was every minute afraid its pearly ornaments, which never fit their
      case, would have fallen at our feet. Mrs. Stainforth gave me a significant
      look of making the same observation, and, catching me fast by the arm,
      said, &ldquo;Come, Miss Burney, let&rsquo;s you and I take care of one
      another&rdquo;; and then she safely toddled me back to Mrs. Schwellenberg,
      who greeted us with saying, &ldquo;Vell! bin you Much amused? Dat Prince
      Villiam&mdash;oders de Duke de Clarrence&mdash;bin raelly ver merry&mdash;oders
      vat you call tipsy!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      BOSWELL&rsquo;s LIFE OF JOHNSON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Turbulent had been reading, like all the rest of the world, Boswell&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;Life of Dr. Johnson,&rdquo; and the preference there expressed of
      Mrs. Lenox to all other females had filled<span class="pagenum">401</span><a
      name="link401" id="link401"></a> him with astonishment, as he had never
      even heard her name.<a href="#linknote-342" name="linknoteref-342"
      id="linknoteref-342"><small>342</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      These occasional sallies of Dr. Johnson, uttered from local causes and
      circumstances, but all retailed verbatim by Mr. Boswell, are filling all
      sort of readers with amaze, except the small part to whom Dr. Johnson was
      known, and who, by acquaintance with the power of the moment over his
      unguarded conversation, know how little of his solid opinion was to be
      gathered from his accidental assertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, who was now also reading this work, applied to me for
      explanations without end. Every night at his period he entered the queen&rsquo;s
      dressing-room, and detained her majesty&rsquo;s proceedings by a length of
      discourse with me upon this subject. All that flowed from himself was
      constantly full of the goodness and benevolence of his character and I was
      never so happy as in the opportunity thus graciously given me of
      vindicating, in instances almost innumerable, the serious principles and
      various excellences of my revered Dr. Johnson from the clouds so
      frequently involving and darkening them, in narrations so little
      calculated for any readers who were strangers to his intrinsic worth, and
      therefore worked upon and struck by what was faulty in his temper and
      manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      I regretted not having strength to read this work to her majesty myself.
      It was an honour I should else have certainly received, for so much wanted
      clearing! so little was understood! However, the queen frequently
      condescended to read over passages and anecdotes which perplexed or
      offended her; and there were none I had not a fair power to soften or to
      justify.

    <h2>
      THE CLOSE OF MISS BURNEY&rsquo;S COURT DUTIES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Her majesty, the day before we left Windsor, gave me to understand my
      attendance would be yet one more fortnight<span class="pagenum">402</span><a
      name="link402" id="link402"></a> requisite, though no longer. I heard this
      with a fearful presentiment I should surely never go through another
      fortnight in so weak and languishing and painful a state of health.
      However, I could but accede, though I fear with no very Courtly grace. So
      melancholy indeed was the state of my mind, from the weakness of my frame,
      that I was never alone but to form scenes of &ldquo;foreign woe,&rdquo;
      where my own disturbance did not occupy me wholly. I began&mdash;almost
      whether I would or not&mdash;another tragedy! The other three all
      unfinished! not one read! and one of them, indeed, only generally sketched
      as to plan and character. But I could go on With nothing; I could only
      suggest and invent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The power of composition has to me indeed proved a blessing! When
      incapable of all else, that, unsolicited, unthought of, has presented
      itself to my solitary leisure, and beguiled me of myself, though it has
      not of late regaled me with gayer associates.
    </p>
    <p>
      July.-I come now to write the last week of my royal residence. The queen
      honoured me with the most uniform graciousness, and though, as the time of
      separation approached, her cordiality rather diminished, and traces of
      internal displeasure appeared sometimes, arising from an opinion I ought
      rather to have struggled on, live or die, than to quit her, yet I am sure
      she saw how poor was my own chance, except by a change in the mode of
      life, and at least ceased to wonder, though she could not approve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was more Courteous, more communicative, more amiable, at very
      meeting: and he condescended to hold me in conversation with him by every
      opportunity, and with an air of such benevolence and goodness, that I
      never felt such ease and pleasure in his notice before. He talked over all
      Mr. Boswell&rsquo;s book, and I related to him sundry anecdotes of Dr.
      Johnson, all highly to his honour, and such as I was eager to make known,
      He always heard me with the utmost complacency and encouraged me to
      proceed in my accounts by every mark of attention and interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told me once, laughing heartily, that, having seen my name in the
      index, he was eager to come to what was said of me, but which he found so
      little, he was surprised and disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ventured to assure him how much I had myself been rejoiced at this very
      circumstance, and with what satisfaction had reflected upon having very
      seldom met Mr. Boswell, as I<span class="pagenum">403</span><a
      name="link403" id="link403"></a> knew there was no other security against
      all manner of risks in his relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time Mr. Turbulent made me a visit at tea-time when the
      gentlemen were at the Castle and the moment William left the room he
      eagerly said, &ldquo;Is this true, Miss Burney, that I hear? Are we going
      to lose you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was much surprised, but Could not deny the charge. He, very
      good-naturedly, declared himself much pleased at a release which he
      protested he thought necessary to my life&rsquo;s preservation. I made him
      tell me the channel through which a business I had guarded SO scrupulously
      Myself had reached him; but it Is too full of windings for writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Mr. de Luc I was already in confidence upon my resignation, and with
      the knowledge of the queen, as he had received the intelligence from
      Germany, whence my successor was now arriving. I then also begged the
      indulgence of writing to Mr. Smelt upon the subject, which was accorded
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My next attack was from Miss Planta. She expressed herself in the deepest
      concern at my retiring, though she not only acknowledged its necessity,
      but confessed she had not thought I could have performed my official duty
      even one year! She broke from me while we talked, leaving me abruptly in a
      violent passion of tears.

    <h2>
      MISS BURNEY&rsquo;S SUCCESSOR. A PENSION FROM THE QUEEN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had soon the pleasure to receive Mlle. Jacobi.<a href="#linknote-343"
      name="linknoteref-343" id="linknoteref-343"><small>343</small></a> She
      brought with her a young German, as her maid, who proved to be her niece,
      but so poor she could not live when her aunt left Germany! Mr. Best, a
      messenger of the king&rsquo;s, brought her to Windsor, and Mrs. Best, his
      wife, accompanied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was extremely pleased with Mlle. Jacobi, who is tall, well made, and
      nearly handsome, and of a humour so gay, an understanding so lively, and
      manners so frank and ingenuous, that I felt an immediate regard for her,
      and we grew mutual good friends. She is the daughter of a dignified
      clergyman of Hanover, high in theological fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all dined with me, and, indeed, Mlle. Jacobi, wanting a thousand
      informations in her new situation, which I was most happy to give her,
      seldom quitted me an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuesday morning I had a conversation, very long and very affecting to me,
      with her majesty. I cannot pretend to detail <span class="pagenum">404</span><a
      name="link404" id="link404"></a> it. I will only tell you she began by
      speaking of Mlle. Jacobi, whom I had the satisfaction to praise, as far as
      had appeared, very warmly and then she led me to talk at large upon the
      nature and requisites and circumstances of the situation I was leaving. I
      said whatever I could suggest that would tend to render my Successor more
      comfortable, and had the great happiness to represent with success the
      consolation and very innocent pleasure she might reap from the society of
      the young relation she had brought over, if she might be permitted to
      treat her at once as a companion, and not as a servant. This was heard
      with the most humane complacency, and I had leave given me to forward the
      plan in various ways. She then conversed upon sundry Subjects, all of them
      confidential in their nature, for near an hour; and then, after a pause,
      said, &ldquo;Do I owe you anything, my dear Miss Burney?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I acquainted her with a debt or two amounting to near seventy pounds. She
      said she would settle it in the afternoon, and then paused again, after
      which, with a look full of benignity, she very expressively said, &ldquo;As
      I don&rsquo;t know your plan, or what you propose, I cannot tell what
      would make you comfortable, but you know the size of my family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I comprehended her, and was immediately interrupting her with assurances
      of my freedom from all expectation or claim; but she stopped me, saying,
      &ldquo;You know what you now have from me:&mdash;the half of that I mean
      to continue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazed and almost overpowered by a munificence I had so little expected or
      thought of, I poured forth the most earnest disclaimings of such a mark of
      her graciousness, declaring I knew too well her innumerable calls to be
      easy in receiving it and much more I uttered to this purpose, with the
      unaffected warmth that animated me at the moment. She heard me almost
      silently; but, in conclusion, Simply, yet strongly, said, &ldquo;I shall
      certainly do that&rdquo; with a stress on the that that seemed to kindly
      mean she would rather have done more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conference was in this stage when the Princess Elizabeth came into the
      room. The queen then retired to the antechamber. My eyes being full, and
      my heart not very empty, I could not then forbear saying to her royal
      highness how much the goodness of the queen had penetrated me. The sweet
      princess spoke feelings I could not expect, by the immediate glistening of
      her soft eyes. She condescended to express her concern At my retiring; but
      most kindly added, &ldquo;However,<span class="pagenum">405</span><a
      name="link405" id="link405"></a> Miss Burney, go when you will, that you
      have this to comfort you, your behaviour has been most perfectly
      honourable.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      LEAVE-TAKINGS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This, my last day at Windsor, was filled with nothing but packing,
      leave-taking, bills-paying, and lessoning to Mlle. Jacobi, who adhered to
      my side through everything, and always with an interest that made its own
      way for her. All the people I had to Settle With poured forth for my
      better health good wishes without end; but amongst the most unwilling for
      my retreat stood poor Mrs. Astley.<a href="#linknote-344"
      name="linknoteref-344" id="linknoteref-344"><small>344</small></a> Indeed
      she quite saddened me by her sadness, and by the recollections of that
      sweet and angelic being her mistress, who had so solaced my early days at
      that place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bryant, too, came this same morning; he had an audience of the queen:
      he knew nothing previously of my design. He seemed thunderstruck. &ldquo;Bless
      me!&rdquo; he cried, in his short and simple but expressive manner,
      &ldquo;so I shall never see you again, never have the honour to dine in
      that apartment with you more!&rdquo; etc. I would have kept him to dinner
      this last day, but he was not well, and would not be persuaded. He would
      not, however, bid me adieu, but promised to endeavour to see me some time
      at Chelsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had then a little note from Miss Gomme, desiring to see me in the
      garden. She had just gathered the news. I do not believe any one Was more
      disposed to be sorry, if the Sight and sense of my illness had not checked
      her concern. She highly approved the step I was taking, and was most
      cordial and kind. Miss Planta came to tell me she must decline dining with
      me, as she felt she should cry all dinner-time, in reflecting upon its
      being our last meal together at Windsor, and this might affront Mlle.
      Jacobi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen deigned to come once more to my apartment this afternoon. She
      brought me the debt. It was a most mixed feeling with which I now saw her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening came Madame de la Fite, I need not tell you, I imagine,
      that her expressions were of &ldquo;la plus vife douleur,&rdquo;; yet she
      owned she could not wonder my father should try what another life would do
      for me. My dear Mrs. de Luc came next; She, alone, knew of this while
      impending. She rejoiced the time of deliverance was arrived, for she had
      <span class="pagenum">406</span><a name="link406" id="link406"></a> often
      feared I should outstay my strength, and sink while the matter was
      arranging. She rejoiced, however, with tears in her kind eyes; and,
      indeed, I took leave of her With true regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nine o&rsquo;clock before I could manage to go down the garden to
      the lower Lodge, to pay my duty to the younger princesses, whom I Could
      not else see at all, as they never go to town for the Court-days. I went
      first up-stairs to Gomme, and had the mortification to learn that the
      sweet Princess Amelia was already gone to bed. This extremely grieved me.
      When or how I may see her lovely little highness more, Heaven only knows!
      Miss Gomme kindly accompanied me to Miss Goldsworthy&rsquo;s apartment,
      and promised me a few more words before I set out the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Mrs. Cheveley, at whose door, and at Miss Neven, her sister&rsquo;s,
      I had tapped and left my name, with Miss Goldsworthy and Dr. Fisher: that
      pleasing and worthy man has just taken a doctor&rsquo;s degree. I waited
      with Miss Goldsworthy till the princesses Mary and Sophia came from the
      upper Lodge, which is when the king and queen go to supper. Their royal
      highnesses, were gracious even to kindness; they shook my hand again and
      again, and wished me better health, and all happiness, with the sweetest
      earnestness. Princess Mary repeatedly desired to see me whenever I came to
      the Queen&rsquo;s house, and condescended to make me as repeatedly promise
      that I would not fail. I was deeply touched by their goodness, and by
      leaving them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday.-In the morning Mrs. Evans, the housekeeper, came to take leave
      of me; and the housemaid of my apartment, who, poor girl, cried bitterly
      that I was going to give place to a foreigner, for Mrs. Schwellenberg&rsquo;s
      severity with servants has made all Germans feared in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      O, but let me first mention that, when I came from the lower Lodge, late
      as it was, I determined to see my old friends the equerries, and not quit
      the place without bidding them adieu. I had never seen them since I had
      dared mention my designed retreat. I told William, therefore, to watch
      their return from the castle, and to give my compliments to either Colonel
      Gwynn or Colonel Goldsworthy, and an invitation to my apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Goldsworthy came instantly. I told him I could not think of
      leaving Windsor without offering first my good<span class="pagenum">407</span><a
      name="link407" id="link407"></a> wishes to all the household. He said
      that, when my intended departure had been published, he and all the
      gentlemen then with him had declared it ought to have taken place six
      months ago. He was extremely courteous, and I begged him to bring to me,
      the rest of his companions that were known to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He immediately fetched Colonel Gwynn, General Grenville, Colonel Ramsden,
      and Colonel Manners. This was the then party. I told him I sent to beg
      their blessing upon my departure. They were all much pleased, apparently,
      that I had not made my exit without seeing them: they all agreed on the
      Urgency of the measure, and we exchanged good wishes most cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Wednesday morning&rsquo;s attendance upon the queen was a melancholy
      office. Miss Goldsworthy as well as Miss Gomme came early to take another
      farewell. I had not time to make any visits in the town, but left
      commissions with Mrs. de Luc and Madame de la Fite. Even Lady Charlotte
      Finch I could not Call upon, though she had made me many kind visits since
      my illness. I wrote to her, however, by Miss Gomme, to thank her, and bid
      her adieu.

    <h2>
      FAREWELL TO KEW.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thursday, July 7.&mdash;This, my last day of office, was big and busy,&mdash;joyful,
      yet affecting to me in a high degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning, before I left Kew, I had my last interview with Mrs.
      Schwellenberg. She was very kind in it, desiring to see me whenever I
      could in town, during her residence at the Queen&rsquo;s house, and to
      hear from me by letter meanwhile. She then much surprised me by an offer
      of succeeding to her own place,&mdash;when it was vacated either by her
      retiring or her death. This was, indeed, a mark of favour and confidence I
      had not expected. I declined, however, to enter upon the subject, as the
      manner in which she opened it made it very solemn, and, to her, very
      affecting. She would take no leave of me, but wished me better hastily,
      and saying we should soon meet, she hurried suddenly out of the room. Poor
      woman! If her temper were not so irascible, I really believe her heart
      would be by no means wanting in kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then took leave of Mrs. Sandys, giving her a token of remembrance in
      return for her constant good behaviour, and<span class="pagenum">408</span><a
      name="link408" id="link408"></a> she showed marks of regard, and of even
      grief, I was sorry to receive, as I could so little return.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the tragedy of tragedies was parting with Goter;<a href="#linknote-345"
      name="linknoteref-345" id="linknoteref-345"><small>345</small></a> that
      poor girl did nothing but cry incessantly from the time she knew of our
      separation. I was very sorry to have no place to recommend her to, though
      I believe she may rather benefit by a vacation that carries her to her
      excellent father and Mother, who teach her nothing but good. I did what I
      could to soften the blow, by every exertion in my power in all ways; for
      it was impossible to be unmoved at her violence of sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then took leave of Kew Palace&mdash;the same party again accompanying
      me, for the last time, in a royal vehicle going by the name of Miss Burney&rsquo;s
      coach.

    <h2>
      THE FINAL PARTING.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I come now near the close of my Court career.
    </h3>
    <p>
      At St. James&rsquo;s all was graciousness; and my royal mistress gave me
      to understand she would have me stay to assist at her toilet after the
      Drawing-room; and much delighted me by desiring my attendance on the
      Thursday fortnight, when she came again to town. This lightened the
      parting in the pleasantest manner possible. When the queen commanded me to
      follow her to her closet I was, indeed, in much emotion; but I told her
      that, as what had passed from Mrs. Schwellenberg in the morning had given
      me to understand her majesty was fixed in her munificent intention,
      notwithstanding what I had most unaffectedly urged against it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;I shall certainly do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet so little,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;had I thought it right to
      dwell upon such an expectation, that, in the belief your majesty would yet
      take it into further consideration, I had not even written It to my
      father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father,&rdquo; she again interrupted me, &ldquo;has nothing to
      do with it; it is solely from me to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me then humbly entreat,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;still in some
      measure to be considered as a servant of your majesty, either as reader,
      or to assist occasionally if Mlle. Jacobi should be ill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked most graciously pleased, and Immediately closed in with the
      proposal, saying, &ldquo;When your health is restored,&mdash;perhaps
      sometimes."<span class="pagenum">409</span><a name="link409" id="link409"></a>
      I then fervently poured forth my thanks for all her goodness, and my
      prayers for her felicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had her handkerchief in her hand or at her eyes the whole time. I was
      so much moved by her condescending kindness, that as soon as I got out of
      the closet I nearly sobbed. I went to help Mlle. Jacobi to put up the
      jewels, that my emotion might the less be observed. The king then came
      into the room. He immediately advanced to the window, where I stood, to
      speak to me. I was not then able to comport myself steadily. I was forced
      to turn my head away from him. He stood still and silent for some minutes,
      waiting to see if I should turn about; but I could not recover myself
      sufficiently to face him, strange as it was to do otherwise; and
      Perceiving me quite overcome he walked away, and I saw him no more. His
      kindness, his goodness, his benignity, never shall I forget&mdash;never
      think of but with fresh gratitude and reverential affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now all going&mdash;I took, for the last time, the cloak of the
      queen, and, putting It over her shoulders, slightly ventured to press
      them, earnestly, though in a low voice, saying, &ldquo;God Almighty bless
      your majesty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned round, and, putting her hand upon my ungloved arm, pressed it
      with the greatest kindness, and said, &ldquo;May you be happy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She left me overwhelmed with tender gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three eldest princesses were in the next room: they ran in to me the
      moment the queen went onward. Princess Augusta and Princess Elizabeth each
      took a hand, and the princess royal put hers over them. I could speak to
      none of them; but they repeated, &ldquo;I wish you happy!&mdash;I wish you
      health!&rdquo; again and again, with the Sweetest eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then set off for Kew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, therefore, end my Court annals; after having lived in the service of
      her majesty five years within ten days&mdash;from July 17, 1786, to July
      7, 1791. <span class="pagenum">410</span><a name="link410" id="link410"></a>

    <h2>
      SECTION 18. (1791-2.) REGAINED LIBERTY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Fanny&rsquo;s rambling journey to the west with Mrs. Ord was a pleasant
      restorative, to mind and body, and bore good fruit hereafter in the pages,
      of &ldquo;The Wanderer.&rdquo; At Bath, in the course of this journey, she
      formed an acquaintance equally interesting and unlooked-for. It was
      certainly singular, to use her own words, &ldquo;that the first visit I
      should make after leaving the queen should be to meet the head of the
      opposition public, the Duchess of Devonshire!&rdquo; The famous Whig
      duchess was then in her thirty-fifth year. Fanny&rsquo;s description of
      her personal charms tallies exactly with the impression which we derive
      from her portraits by Reynolds and Gainsborough: that their celebrity was
      due rather to expressiveness and animation than to a countenance regularly
      beautiful. But the charming duchess, like most other people, had a
      skeleton in her closet. Notwithstanding her high spirits, and &ldquo;native.
      cheerfulness,&rdquo; &ldquo;she appeared to me not happy,&rdquo; writes
      our penetrating Diarist. What was the skeleton? Not gambling debts,
      although the duchess followed the fashion of the day, and Sheridan
      declared that he had handed her into her carriage when she was literally
      sobbing at her losses. Fanny gives us a hint, slight but unmistakeable. At
      their first meeting the duchess was accompanied by another lady&mdash;a
      beautiful, alluring woman, with keen dark eyes, who smiled, some one said,
      &ldquo;like Circe.&rdquo; Lady Spencer introduced her daughter to Miss
      Burney with warm pleasure, and then, &ldquo;slightly and as if
      unavoidably,&rdquo; named the beautiful enchantress&mdash;Lady Elizabeth
      Foster. It is only necessary to add that in 1809, some three years after
      the death of his first wife, the Duchess Georgiana, the Duke of Devonshire
      married again, and his second wife was Lady Elizabeth Foster.-ED.] <span
      class="pagenum">411</span><a name="link411" id="link411"></a> RELEASED
      FROM DUTY.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chelsea College, July.-My dear father was waiting for me in my apartment
      at St. James&rsquo;s when their majesties and their fair royal daughters
      were gone. He brought me home, and welcomed me most sweetly. My heart was
      a little sad, in spite of its contentment. My joy in quitting my place
      extended not to quitting the king and queen; and the final marks of their
      benign favour had deeply impressed me. My mother received me according to
      my wishes, and Sarah Most cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear James and Charles speedily came to see me; and one precious
      half-day I was indulged with my kind Mr. Locke and his Fredy. If i had
      been stouter and stronger in health, I should then have been almost
      flightily happy; but the Weakness of the frame still kept the rest in
      order. My ever-kind Miss Cambridge was also amongst the foremost to hasten
      with congratulations on my return to my old ways and to make me promise to
      visit Twickenham after my projected tour with Mrs. Ord.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could myself undertake no visiting at this time; rest and quiet being
      quite essential to my recovery. But my father did the honours for me
      amongst those who had been most interested in my resignation. He called
      instantly upon Sir Joshua Reynolds and Miss Palmer, and Mr. Burke; and he
      wrote to Mr. Walpole, Mr. Seward, Mrs. Crewe, Mr. Windham, and my
      Worcester uncle. Mr. Walpole wrote the most charming of answers, In the
      gallantry of the old Court, and with all its wit, concluding with a warm
      invitation to Strawberry Hill. Sir Joshua and Miss Palmer Sent me every
      species of kind exultation. Mr. Burke was not in town. Mr. Seward wrote
      very heartily and cordially, and came also when my Susanna was here. Mrs.
      Crewe immediately pressed me to come and recruit at Crewe Hall in
      Cheshire, where she promised me repose, and good air, and good society.

    <h2>
      A WESTERN JOURNEY: FARNHAM CASTLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sidmouth, Devonshire, Monday, Aug. 1.&mdash;I have now been a week out
      upon my travels, but have not had the means or the time, till this moment,
      to attempt their brief recital.<span class="pagenum">412</span><a
      name="link412" id="link412"></a> Mrs. Ord called for me about ten in the
      morning. I left my dearest father with the less regret, as his own journey
      to Mrs. crewe was very soon to take place. It was a terribly rainy
      morning, but I was eager not to postpone the excursion. As we travelled on
      towards Staines, I could scarcely divest myself of the idea that I was but
      making again my usual journey to Windsor; and I could with difficulty
      forbear calling Mrs. Ord Miss Planta during the whole of that well-known
      road. I did not, indeed, take her maid, who was our third in the coach,
      for Mr. de Luc, or Mr. Turbulent; but the place she occupied made me think
      much more of those I so long had had for my vis-a-vis than of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went on no farther than to Bagshot: thirty miles was the extremity of
      our powers; but I bore them very tolerably, though variably. We put up at
      the best inn, very early, and then inquired what we could see In the town
      and neighbourhood. &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; was the concise answer of a
      staring maid. We determined, therefore, to prowl to the churchyard, and
      read the tombstone inscriptions: but when we asked the way, the same
      woman, staring still more wonderingly, exclaimed, &ldquo;Church! There&rsquo;s
      no church nigh here!&mdash;There&rsquo;s the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s, just
      past the turning. You may go and see that, if you will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So on we walked towards this hunting Villa: but after toiling up a long
      unweeded avenue, we had no sooner opened the gate to the parks than a few
      score of dogs, which were lying in ambush, Set Up so prodigious a variety
      of magnificent barkings, springing forward at the same time, that, content
      with having caught a brief view of the seat, we left them to lord it over
      the domain they regarded as their own, and, with all due Submission,
      pretty hastily shut the gate, without troubling them to give us another
      salute. We returned to the inn, and read B&mdash;-&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lives of
      the Family of the Boyles.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aug. 2.&mdash;We proceeded to Farnham to breakfast, and thence walked to
      the castle. The Bishop of Winchester, Mrs. North, and the whole family are
      gone abroad. The castle is a good old building, with as much of modern
      elegance and fashion intermixed in its alterations and fitting up as Mrs.
      North could possibly contrive to weave into its ancient grandeur.... I
      wished I could have climbed to the top of an old tower, much out of
      repair, but so high, that I fancied I could thence have espied the hills
      of Norrbury. However, I was ready to fall already, from only ascending the
      slope to reach the castle. <span class="pagenum">413</span><a
      name="link413" id="link413"></a> A PARTY OF FRENCH FUGITIVES.
    </p>
    <p>
      We arrived early at Winchester; but the town was so full, as the judges
      were expected next morning, that we could only get one bed-chamber, in
      which Mrs. Ord, her maid, and myself reposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just after we had been obliged to content ourselves with this scanty
      accommodation, we saw a very handsome coach and four horses, followed by a
      chaise and outriders, stop at the gate, and heard the mistress of the
      house declare she could not receive the company; and the postilions, at
      the same time, protested the horses could go no farther. They inquired for
      fresh horses; there were none to be had in the whole city; and the party
      were all forced to remain in their carriages, without horses, at the
      inn-gate, for the chance of what might pass on the road. We asked who they
      were, and our pity was doubled in finding them foreigners.
    </p>
    <p>
      We strolled about the upper part of the city, leaving the cathedral for
      the next morning. We saw a large, uniform, handsome palace, which is
      called by the inhabitants &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; and which
      was begun by Charles II. We did not, therefore, expect the elegant
      architecture of his father&rsquo;s days. One part, they particularly told
      us, was designed for Nell Gwynn. It was never finished, and neglect has
      taken place of time in rendering it a most ruined structure, though, as it
      bears no marks of antiquity, it has rather the appearance of owing its
      destruction to a fire than to the natural decay of age. It is so spacious,
      however, and stands so magnificently to overlook the city, that I wish it
      to be completed for an hospital or infirmary. I have written Mrs.
      Schwellenberg an account of its appearance and state, which I am sure will
      be read by her majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we returned to the Inn, still the poor travellers were in the same
      situation: they looked so desolate, and could so indifferently make
      themselves understood, that Mrs. Ord good-naturedly invited them to drink
      tea with us. They most thankfully accepted the offer, and two ladies and
      two gentlemen ascended the stairs with us to our dining-room. The chaise
      had the female servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder lady was so truly French&mdash;so vive and so triste in turn&mdash;that
      she seemed formed from the written character of a Frenchwoman, such, at
      least, as we English write them. She was very forlorn in her air, and very
      sorrowful in her countenance; <span class="pagenum">414</span><a
      name="link414" id="link414"></a>yet all action and gesture, and of an
      animation when speaking nearly fiery in its vivacity: neither pretty nor
      young, but neither ugly nor old; and her smile, which was rare, had a
      finesse very engaging; while her whole demeanour announced a person Of
      consequence, and all her discourse told that she was well-informed,
      well-educated, and well-bred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other lady, whom they called mademoiselle, as the first madame, was
      young, dark but clear and bright in her eyes and complexion, though
      without good features, or a manner of equal interest with the lady she
      accompanied. She proved, however, sensible, and seemed happy in the
      general novelty around her. She spoke English pretty well, and was admired
      without mercy by the rest of the party, as a perfect mistress of the
      language. The madame spoke it very ill indeed, but pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the two gentlemen, one they called only monsieur, and the other the
      madame addressed as her brother. The monsieur was handsome, rather
      tonnish, and of the high haughty ton, and seemed the devoted attendant or
      protector of the madame, who sometimes spoke to him almost with asperity,
      from eagerness, and a tinge of wretchedness and impatience, which coloured
      all she said; and, at other times, softened off her vehemence with a smile
      the most expressive, and which made its way to the mind immediately, by
      coming with sense and meaning, and not merely from good humour and good
      spirits as the more frequent smiles of happier persons. The brother seemed
      lively and obliging, and entirely at the devotion of his sister, who gave
      him her commands with an authority that would not have brooked dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      They told us they were just come from Southampton, which they had visited
      in their way from viewing the fleet at the Isle of Wight and Portsmouth,
      and they meant to go on now to Bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      We soon found they were aristocrats, which did better for them with Mrs.
      Ord and me than it would have done with you republicans of Norbury and
      Mickleham; yet I wish you had all met the madame, and heard her Indignant
      unhappiness. They had been in England but two months. They all evidently
      belonged to madame, who appeared to me a fugitive just before the flight
      of the French king,<a href="#linknote-346" name="linknoteref-346"
      id="linknoteref-346"><small>346</small></a> or in consequence of his
      having been taken.<span class="pagenum">415</span><a name="link415"
      id="link415"></a> She entered upon her wretched situation very soon,
      lamenting that he was, in fact, no king, and bewailing his want of courage
      for his trials. The queen she never mentioned. She spoke once or twice of
      son mari, but did not say who or what he was, nor where.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;In France they have now liberty!
      Who has liberty, le peuple, or the mob? Not les honnetes gens; for those
      whose principles are known to be aristocratic must fly, or endure every
      danger and indignity. Ah! est-ce la la liberte?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The monsieur said he had always been the friend of liberty, such as it was
      in England; but in France it was general tyranny. &ldquo;In England,&rdquo;
      he cried, &ldquo;he was a true democrat, though bien aristocrate in
      France.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; said the poor madame, &ldquo;formerly, in all the
      sorrows of life, we had nos terres to which we could retire, and there
      forget them, and dance, and sing, and laugh, and fling them all aside,
      till forced back to Paris. But now our villas are no protection: we may be
      safe, but the first offence conceived by le peuple is certain destruction;
      and, without a moment&rsquo;s warning, we may be forced to fly our own
      roofs, and see them and all we are worth burnt before our eyes in horrible
      triumph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all said in French. But the anguish of her Countenance filled me
      with compassion, though it was scarcely possible to restrain a smile when,
      the moment after, she said she might be very wrong, but she hoped I would
      forgive her if she owned she preferred Paris incomparably to London and
      pitied me very unreservedly for never having seen that first of cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sole hope, she said, for the overthrow of that anarchy in which the
      Unguarded laxity of the king had plunged the first Country in the world,&mdash;vous
      me pardonnee, Mademoiselle,&mdash;was now from the German princes, who,
      she flattered herself, would rise In their own defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told me, the next moment, of les spectacles I should find at
      Southampton, and asked me what she might expect at Bath of public
      amusement and buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was travelling I said, for my health, and Should visit no theatres,
      ball-rooms, etc., and could recommend none.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not seem to comprehend me; yet, in the midst of<span
      class="pagenum">416</span><a name="link416" id="link416"></a> naming these
      places, she sighed as deeply from the bottom of her heart as if she had
      been forswearing the world for ever in despair. But it was necessary, she
      said, when unhappy, to go abroad the more, pour se distraire. In parting,
      they desired much to renew acquaintance with us when we returned to
      London. Mrs. Ord gave her direction to the monsieur, who in return, wrote
      theirs&mdash;&ldquo;The French ladies, NO. 30, Gerrard-street, Soho.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They stayed till our early hour Of retiring made Mrs. Ord suffer them to
      go. I was uneasy to know what would become of them. I inquired of a
      waiter: he unfeelingly laughed, and said, &ldquo;O! they do well enough;
      they&rsquo;ve got a room.&rdquo; I asked if he could yet let them have
      beds to stay, or horses to proceed? &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered he,
      sneeringly: &ldquo;but it don&rsquo;t matter for, now they&rsquo;ve got a
      room, they are as merry and capering as if they were going to dance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just after this, Mrs. Stephenson, Mrs. Ord&rsquo;s maid, came running in.
      &ldquo;La! ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so
      frightened, you can&rsquo;t think: the French folks sent for me on
      purpose, to ask t&rsquo;other lady&rsquo;s name, they said, and they had
      asked William before, so they knew it; but they said I must write it down,
      and where she lived; so I was forced to write, &lsquo;Miss Burney,
      Chelsea,&rsquo; and they fell a smiling so at one another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Twas impossible to help laughing; but we desired her, in return, to send
      for one of their maids and ask their names also. She came back, and said
      she could not understand the maids, and so they had called one of the
      gentlemen, and he had written down &ldquo;Madame la Comtesse de Menage, et
      Mlle. de Beaufort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We found, afterwards, they had sat up till two in the morning, and then
      procured horses and journeyed towards Oxford.

    <h2>
      WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aug. 3.&mdash;We walked to the cathedral, and saw it completely. Part of
      it remains from the original Saxon building, though neglected, except by
      travellers, as the rest of the church is ample for all uses, and alone
      kept in repair. The bones of eleven Saxon kings are lodged in seven
      curious old chests, in which they were deposited after being dug up and
      disturbed in the civil wars and ensuing confusions. The small number of
      chests is owing to the small proportion remaining of some of the
      skeletons, which occasioned their being united with others. <span
      class="pagenum">417</span><a name="link417" id="link417"></a> The Saxon
      characters are in many inscriptions preserved, though in none entire. They
      were washing a plaster from the walls, to discern some curious old
      painting, very miserable, but very entertaining, of old legends, which
      some antiquaries are now endeavouring to discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      William of Wykham, by whom the cathedral was built in its present form,
      lies buried, with his effigy and whole monument in very fine alabaster,
      and probably very like, as it was done, they aver, before he died. Its
      companion, equally superb, is Cardinal Beaufort, uncle of Harry VI.
      William Rufus, slain in the neighbouring forest, is buried in the old
      choir: his monument is of plain stone, without any inscription or
      ornament, and only shaped like a coffin. Hardyknute had a much more
      splendid monument preserved for him; but Harry I. had other business to
      attend, I presume, than to decorate the tomb of one brother while
      despoiling of his kingdom another. An extremely curious old chapel and
      monument remain of Archbishop Langton, of valuable gothic workmanship. The
      altar, which is highly adorned with gold, was protected in Cromwell&rsquo;s
      time by the address and skill of the Winton inhabitants, who ran up a
      slight wall before it, and deceived the reformists, soi-disants. I could
      hardly quit this poor dear old building, so much I was interested with its
      Saxon chiefs, its little queer niches, quaint images, damp cells,
      mouldering walls, and mildewed pillars. One chest contains the bones
      entire of Egbert, our first king. Edred, also. I distinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The screen was given to this church by King Charles, and is the work of
      Inigo Jones. It is very simple in point of ornament, very complete in
      taste and elegance; nevertheless, a screen of Grecian architecture in a
      cathedral of gothic workmanship was ill, I think, imagined.

    <h2>
      STONEHENGE, WILTON, AND MILTON ABBEY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aug. 5.&mdash;We went to Stonehenge. Here I was prodigiously disappointed,
      at first, by the huge masses of stone so unaccountably piled at the summit
      of Salisbury Plain. However, we alighted, and the longer I surveyed and
      considered them, the more augmented my wonder and diminished my
      disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then went on to Wilton, where I renewed my delight over the exquisite
      Vandykes, and with the statues, busts, and pictures, which again I
      sighingly quitted, with a longing wish<span class="pagenum">418</span><a
      name="link418" id="link418"></a> I might ever pass under that roof time
      enough to see them more deliberately. We stopped in the Hans Holbein
      Porch, and upon the Inigo Jones bridge, as long as we Could stand, after
      standing and staring and straining our eyes till our guide was quite
      fatigued. &lsquo;Tis a noble collection; and how might it be enjoyed if,
      as an arch rustic Old labouring man told u, fine folks lived as they ought
      to do!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday, Aug. 7.&mdash;After an early dinner we set off for Milton Abbey,
      the seat of Lord Milton, partly constructed from the old abbey and partly
      new. There is a magnificent gothic hall in excellent preservation, of
      evident Saxon workmanship, and extremely handsome, though not of the airy
      beauty of the chapel. The situation of this abbey is truly delicious: it
      is in a vale of extreme fertility and richness, surrounded by hills of the
      most exquisite form, and mostly covered with hanging woods, but so varied
      in their growth and groups, that the eye is perpetually fresh caught with
      objects of admiration. &lsquo;Tis truly a lovely place.

    <h2>
      LYME AND SIDMOUTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aug. 8.&mdash;We proceeded to Bridport, a remarkably clean town, with the
      air so clear and pure, it seemed a new climate. Hence we set out, after
      dinner, for Lyme, and the road through which we travelled is the most
      beautiful to which my wandering destinies have yet sent me. It is
      diversified with all that can compose luxuriant scenery, and with just as
      much of the approach to sublime as is in the province of unterrific
      beauty. The hills are the highest, I fancy, in the south of this county&mdash;the
      boldest and noblest; the vales of the finest verdure, wooded and watered
      as if only to give ideas of finished landscapes; while the whole, from
      time to time, rises into still superior grandeur, by openings between the
      heights that terminate the View With the Splendour of the British channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no going on in the carriage through such enchanting scenes; we
      got out upon the hills, and walked till we could walk no longer. The
      descent down to Lyme is uncommonly steep; and indeed is very striking,
      from the magnificence of the ocean that washes its borders. Chidiock and
      Charmouth, two villages between Bridport and Lyme, are the very prettiest
      I have ever seen. During the whole of this post I was fairly taken away,
      not only from the world but from myself, and completely wrapped up and
      engrossed by the <span class="pagenum">419</span><a name="link419"
      id="link419"></a> pleasures, wonders, and charms of animated nature, thus
      seen in fair perfection. Lyme, however, brought me to myself; for the part
      by the sea, where we fixed our abode, was so dirty and fishy that I
      rejoiced when we left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aug. 9.&mdash;We travelled to Sidmouth. And here we have taken up our
      abode for a week. It was all devoted to rest and sea-air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidmouth is built in a vale by the sea-coast, and the terrace for company
      is nearer to the ocean than any I have elsewhere seen, and therefore both
      more pleasant and more commodious. The little bay is of a most peaceful
      kind, and the sea was as calm and gentle as the Thames. I longed to bathe,
      but I am in no state now to take liberties with myself, and, having no
      advice at hand, I ran no risk.

    <h2>
      SIDMOUTH LOYALTY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nothing has given me so much pleasure since I came to this place as our
      landlady&rsquo;s account of her own and her town&rsquo;s loyalty. She is a
      baker, a poor widow woman, she told us, who lost her husband by his fright
      in thinking he saw a ghost, just after her mother was drowned. She carries
      on the business, with the help of her daughter, a girl about fifteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I inquired of her if she had seen the royal family when they visited
      Devonshire? &ldquo;Yes, sure, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;there
      was ne&rsquo;er a soul left in all this place for going out to see &lsquo;em.
      My daughter and I rode a double horse, and we went to Sir George Young&rsquo;s,
      and got into the park, for we knew the housekeeper, and she gave my
      daughter a bit to taste of the king&rsquo;s dinner when they had all done,
      and she said she might talk on it when she was a old woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked another good woman, who came in for some flour, if she had been of
      the party? &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;she was ill, but she had had
      holiday enough upon the king&rsquo;s recovery, for there was such a
      holiday then as the like was not in all England.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sure, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; cried the poor baker-woman, &ldquo;we
      all did our best then for there was ne&rsquo;er a town in all England like
      Sidmouth for rejoicing. Why, I baked a hundred and ten penny loaves for
      the poor, and so did every baker in town, and there&rsquo;s three, and the
      gentry subscribed for it. And the gentry roasted a bullock and cut it all
      up, and we all eat it, in the midst of the rejoicing. And then we had such
      a fine page 420 sermon, it made us all cry; there was a more tears shed
      than ever was known, all for over-joy. And they had the king drawed, and
      dressed up all in gold and laurels, and they put un in a coach and eight
      horses, and carried un about; and all the grand gentlemen in the town, and
      all abouts, come in their own carriages to join. And they had the finest
      band of music in all England singing &lsquo;God save the king,&rsquo; and
      every Soul joined in the chorus, and all not so much because he was a
      king, but because they said a was such a worthy gentleman, and that the
      like of him was never known in this nation before: so we all subscribed
      for the illuminations for that reason, some a shilling, some a guinea, and
      some a penny,&mdash;for no one begrudged it, as a was such a worthy
      person.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This good Mrs. Dare has purchased images of all the royal family, in her
      great zeal, and I had them in my apartment&mdash;King, Queen, Prince of
      Wales, Dukes of York, Clarence, Kent, Sussex, Cumberland, and Cambridge;
      Princess Royal, and Princesses Augusta, Eliza, Mary, Sophia, and Amelia,

    <h2>
      POWDERHAM CASTLE AND COLLUMPTON CHURCH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aug. 16.&mdash;We quitted Sidmouth, and proceeded through the finest
      country possible to Exmouth, to see that celebrated spot of beauty. The
      next morning we crossed the Ex and visited Powderham Castle. Its
      appearance, noble and antique without, loses all that character from
      French finery and minute elegance and gay trappings within. The present
      owner, Lord Courtney, has fitted it up in the true Gallic taste, and every
      room has the air of being ornamented for a gala. The housekeeper did not
      let us see half the castle; she only took us to those rooms which the
      present lord has modernized and fitted up in the sumptuous French taste;
      the old part of the castle she doubtless thought would disgrace him;
      forgetting or rather never knowing&mdash;that the old part alone was worth
      a traveller&rsquo;s curiosity, since the rest might be anticipated by a
      visit to any celebrated cabinet-maker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thence we proceeded to Star Cross to dine; and saw on the opposite coast
      the house Of Sir Francis Drake, which was built by his famous ancestor.
      Here we saw a sight that reminded me of the drawings of Webber from the
      South Sea Isles; women scarce clothed at all, with feet and legs entirely
      naked, straw bonnets of uncouth Shapes tied on their heads, a <span
      class="pagenum">421</span><a name="link421" id="link421"></a> sort of man&rsquo;s
      jacket on their bodies, and their short coats pinned up in the form of
      concise trousers, very succinct! and a basket on each arm, strolling along
      with wide mannish strides to the borders of the river, gathering cockles.
      They looked, indeed, miserable and savage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence we went, through very beautiful roads, to Exeter. That great old
      city is too narrow, too populous, too dirty, and too ill-paved, to meet
      with my applause. Next morning we breakfasted at Collumpton, and visited
      its church. Here we saw the remains of a once extremely rich gothic
      structure, though never large. There is all the appearance of its having
      been the church of an abbey before the Reformation. It is situated in a
      deep but most fertile vale; its ornaments still retain so much of gilding,
      painting, and antique splendour, as could never have belonged to a mere
      country church. The wood carving, too, though in ruins, is most
      laboriously well done; the roof worked in blue and gold, lighter, but in
      the style of the royal chapel at St. James&rsquo;s we were quite surprised
      to find such a structure in a town so little known or named. One aisle was
      added by a clothier of the town in the reign of Edward VI.; probably upon
      its first being used as a protestant and public place of worship. This is
      still perfect, but very clumsy and inelegant compared with the ancient
      part. The man, to show he gloried in the honest profession whence he
      derived wealth for this good purpose, has his arms at one corner, with his
      name, J. Lane, in gothic characters, and on the opposite corner his image,
      terribly worked in the wall, with a pair of shears in one hand, so large
      as to cut across the figure downwards almost obscuring all but his feet.
      Till the cicerone explained this, I took the idea for a design of Death,
      placed where most conspicuously he might show himself, ready to cut in two
      the poor objects that entered the church.

    <h2>
      GLASTONBURY ABBEY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aug. 19.&mdash;To vary the scenery we breakfasted at Bridgewater, in as
      much dirt and noise, from the judges filling the town, as at Taunton we
      had enjoyed neatness and quiet. We walked beside the river, which is
      navigable from the Bristol channel; and a stream more muddy, and a quay
      more dirty and tarry and pitchy, I would not covet to visit again. It is
      here called the Perrot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thence, however, we proceeded to what made amends<span class="pagenum">422</span><a
      name="link422" id="link422"></a> all&mdash;the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey.
      These are the most elegant remains of monkish grandeur I have ever chanced
      to see,&mdash;the forms, designs, ornaments,&mdash;all that is left is in
      the highest perfection of gothic beauty. Five hundred souls, the people
      told us, were supported in this abbey and its cloisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chapel of Joseph of Arimathea has the outworks nearly entire, and I was
      quite bewitched with their antique beauty. But the entrance into the main
      front of the abbey is stupendous; its height is such that the eye aches to
      look up at it, though it is now curtailed, by no part of its arch
      remaining except the first inclination towards that form, which shows it
      to have been the entrance. Not a bit of roof remains in any part. All the
      monuments that were not utterly decayed or destroyed have been removed to
      Wells. Mere walls alone are left here, except the monks&rsquo; kitchen.
      This is truly curious: it is a circular building, with a dome as high&mdash;higher
      I fancy&mdash;than the Pantheon&rsquo;s; four immense fireplaces divide it
      Into four parts at the bottom, and an oven still is visible. One statue is
      left in one niche, which the people about said was of the abbot&rsquo;s
      chief cook!
    </p>
    <p>
      If this monastery was built by the famous old cruel hypocrite abbot,
      Dunstan, I shall grieve so much taste was bestowed on such a wretch.<a
      href="#linknote-347" name="linknoteref-347" id="linknoteref-347"><small>347</small></a>
      We had only labourers for our informants. But one boy was worth hearing:
      he told me there was a well of prodigious depth, which he showed me, and
      this well had long been dried up, and so covered over as to be forgotten,
      till his grandfather dreamed a dream that the water of this well would
      restore him from a bad state of health to good; so he dug, and the well
      was found, and he drank the water and was cured! And since then the poor
      came from all parts who were afflicted with diseases, and drank the water
      and were cured. One woman was now at Glastonbury to try it, and already
      almost well! What strange inventions and superstitions even the ruins of
      what had belonged to St. Dunstan can yet engender! The Glastonbury thorn
      we forgot to ask for.

    <h2>
      WELLS CATHEDRAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hence we proceeded to Wells. Here we waited, as usual, upon the cathedral,
      which received our compliments with but <span class="pagenum">423</span><a
      name="link423" id="link423"></a> small return of civility. There was
      little to be seen without, except old monuments of old abbots removed from
      Glastonbury, so inferior in workmanship and design to the abbey once
      containing them, that I was rather displeased than gratified by the sight.
      They have also a famous clock, brought from the abbey at Its general
      demolition. This exhibits a set of horses with riders, who curvet a dance
      round a bell by the pulling a string, with an agility comic enough, and
      fitted to serve for a puppet-show; which, in all probability, was its
      design, in order to recreate the poor monks at their hours of play.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a figure of St. Dunstan, who regularly strikes the quarters
      of every hour by clock-work, and who holds in his hand a pair of tongs&mdash;the
      same I suppose as those with which he was wont to pull the devil by the
      nose, in their nocturnal interviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old castle of Wells is now the palace for the bishop. It is moated
      still, and looks dreary, Secluded, and in the bad old style.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night, upon a deeply deliberate investigation in the medical way, it
      was suddenly resolved that we should proceed to Bath instead of Bristol,
      and that I should try there first the stream of King Bladud. So now, at
      this moment, here we are.

      BATH REVISITED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Queen Square, Bath, Aug. 20.&mdash;-Bath is extremely altered since I last
      visited it. Its circumference is perhaps trebled but its buildings are so
      unfinished, so spread, so everywhere beginning and nowhere ending, that it
      looks rather like a space of ground lately fixed upon for erecting a town,
      than a town itself, of so many years&rsquo; duration. It is beautiful and
      wonderful throughout. The hills are built up and down, and the vales so
      stocked with streets and houses, that, in some places, from the
      ground-floor on one side a street, you cross over to the attic of your
      opposite neighbour. The white stone, where clean, has a beautiful effect,
      and, even where worn, a grand one. But I must not write a literal Bath
      guide, and a figurative one Anstey <a href="#linknote-348"
      name="linknoteref-348" id="linknoteref-348"><small>348</small></a> has all
      to himself. I will only tell you in brief, yet in truth, it looks a city
      of palaces, a town of hills, and a hill of towns.<span class="pagenum">424</span><a
      name="link424" id="link424"></a> O how have I thought, in patrolling it,
      of my poor Mrs. Thrale! I went to look (and sigh at the sight) at the
      house on the North parade where we dwelt, and almost every Old place
      brings to my mind some scene in which we were engaged. Besides the
      constant sadness of all recollections that bring fresh to my thoughts a
      breach with a friend once so loved, how are most of the families altered
      and dispersed in these absent ten Years! From Mrs. Montagu&rsquo;s, Miss
      Gregory by a marriage disapproved, is removed for ever; from Mrs. Cholmley&rsquo;s,
      by the severer blow of death, Lady Mulgrave is separated; Mrs. Lambart, by
      the same blow, has lost the brother, Sir Philip Clerke, who brought us to
      her acquaintance; Mr. Bowdler and his excellent eldest daughter have
      yielded to the same stroke; Mrs. Byron has followed. Miss Leigh has been
      married and widowed; Lord Mulgrave has had the same hard lot; and, besides
      these, Mrs. Cotton, Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s aunt, Lady Miller, and Mr. Thrale
      himself, are no more.

    <h2>
      A VISIT FROM LADY SPENCER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aug. 31.&mdash;I found I had no acquaintance here, except Mr. Harrington,
      who is ill, Mrs. Hartley, who is too lame for visiting, and the Vanbrughs;
      and though Mrs. Ord, from her frequent residence here, knows many of the
      settled inhabitants, she has kindly complied with my request of being
      dispensed from making new visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after we came, while I was finishing some letters, and quite alone,
      Mrs. Ord&rsquo;s servant brought me word Lady Spencer would ask me how I
      did, if I was well enough to receive her. Of course I begged she might
      come up-stairs. I have met her two or three times at my dearest Mrs.
      Delany&rsquo;s, where I met, also, with marked civilities from her. I knew
      she was here, with her unhappy daughter,&mdash;Lady Duncannon,<a
      href="#linknote-349" name="linknoteref-349" id="linknoteref-349"><small>349</small></a>
      whom she assiduously nurses, aided by her more celebrated other daughter,
      the Duchess of Devonshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a very flattering apology for coming, and then began to converse
      upon my beloved Mrs. Delany, and thence to subjects more general. She is a
      sensible and sagacious character, intelligent, polite, and agreeable, and
      she spends her life in such exercises of active charity and zeal, that she<span
      class="pagenum">425</span><a name="link425" id="link425"></a> would be one
      of the most exemplary women of rank of the age, had she less of show in
      her exertions, and more of forbearance in publishing them. My dear oracle,
      however, once said, vainglory must not be despised or discouraged, when it
      operated but as a human engine for great or good deeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke of Lady Duncannon&rsquo;s situation with much sorrow, and
      expatiated upon her resignation to her fate, her prepared state for death,
      and the excellence of her principles, with an eagerness and feeling that
      quite overwhelmed me with surprise and embarrassment. Her other daughter
      she did not mention; but her grand-daughter, Lady Georgiana Cavendish, she
      spoke of with rapture. Miss Trimmer, also, the eldest daughter of the
      exceeding worthy Mrs. Trimmer, she named with a regard that seemed quite
      affectionate. She told me she had the care of the young Lady Cavendishes,
      but was in every respect treated as if one of themselves.

    <h2>
      BATH SUNDAY SCHOOLS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The name of Mrs. Trimmer led us to talk of the Sunday schools and Schools
      of Industry. They are both in a very flourishing state at Bath, and Lady
      Spencer has taken one school under her own immediate patronage. The next
      day, of course, I waited on her&mdash;she was out. But the following day,
      which was Sunday, she sent me a message up-stairs to say she would take me
      to see the Sunday-school, if I felt well enough to desire it. She waited
      below for my answer, which, of course, I carried down in my proper person,
      ready hatted and cloaked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a most interesting sight. Such a number of poor innocent children,
      all put into a way of right, most taken immediately from every way of
      wrong, lifting Up their little hands, and joining in those prayers and
      supplications for mercy and grace, which, even if they understand not,
      must at least impress them with a general idea of religion, a dread of
      evil, and a love of good; it was, indeed, a sight to expand the best hopes
      of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt very much obliged to my noble conductress, with whom I had much
      talk upon the subject in our walk back. Her own little school, of course,
      engaged us the most. She told me that the next day six of her little girls
      were to be new clothed, by herself, in honour of the birthday of the Duke
      of Devonshire&rsquo;s second daughter, Lady Harriot Cavendish, who <span
      class="pagenum">426</span><a name="link426" id="link426"></a> was to come
      to her grandmamma&rsquo;s house to see the ceremony. To this sight she
      also Invited me, and I accepted her kindness with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day, therefore, Monday, I obeyed Lady Spencer&rsquo;s time,
      and at six o&rsquo;clock was at her house in Gay-street. Lady Spencer had
      Mrs. Mary Pointz and Miss Trimmer with her; and the six children, just
      prepared for Lady Harriot, in their new gowns, were dismissed from their
      examination, upon my arrival, and sent down-stairs to Wait the coming of
      her little ladyship, who, having dined with her mamma, was later than her
      appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Georgiana is just eight Years old. She has a fine, animated, sweet,
      and handsome countenance, and the form and figure of a girl of ten or
      twelve years of age. Lady Harriot, who this day was six Years old, is by
      no means so handsome, but has an open and pleasing countenance, and a look
      of the most happy disposition. Lady Spencer brought her to me immediately.
      I inquired after the young Marquis of Hartington. Lady Spencer told me
      they never trusted him from the Upper walks, near his house, in
      Marlborough-buildings. He has a house of his own near the duke&rsquo;s,
      and a carriage entirely to himself; but YOU will see the necessity of
      these appropriations, when I remind You he is now fourteen months old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Spencer had now a lottery&mdash;without blanks, you will suppose&mdash;of
      playthings and toys for the children. She distributed the prizes, and Lady
      Duncannon held the tickets. During this entered Lord Spencer, the son of
      Lady Spencer, who was here only for three days, to see his sister
      Duncannon. They had all dined with the little Lady Harriot. The duke is
      now at Chatsworth, in Derbyshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought of Lord Spencer&rsquo;s kindness to Charles, and I recollected
      he was a favourite of Mr. Windham. I saw him, therefore, with very
      different ideas to those raised by the sight of his poor sister Duncannon,
      to whom he made up with every mark of pitying affection; she, meanwhile,
      receiving him with the most expressive pleasure, though nearly silent. I
      could not help feeling touched, in defiance of all obstacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently followed two ladies. Lady Spencer, with a look and manner warmly
      announcing pleasure in what she was doing, then introduced me to the first
      of them, saying, &ldquo;Duchess of Devonshire, Miss Burney.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She made me a very civil compliment upon hoping my<span class="pagenum">427</span><a
      name="link427" id="link427"></a> health was recovering, and Lady Spencer
      then, shortly, and as if unavoidably, said, &ldquo;Lady Elizabeth Foster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I have neglected to mention, in its place, that the six poor little girls
      had a repast in the garden, and Lady Georgiana earnestly begged leave to
      go down and see and speak with them. She applied to Lady Spencer. &ldquo;O
      grandmamma,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;pray let me go! Mamma says it all
      depends upon you.&rdquo; The duchess expressed some fear lest there might
      be any illness or disorder among the poor things: Lady Spencer answered
      for them; and Lady Georgiana, with a sweet delight, flew down into the
      garden, all the rest accompanying, and Lady Spencer and the duchess soon
      following. It was a beautiful sight, taken in all its dependencies, from
      the windows. Lord Spencer presently joined them.

    <h2>
      GEORGIANA, DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE
    </h2>
    <p>
      To return to the duchess. I did not find so much beauty in her as I
      expected, notwithstanding the variations of accounts; but I found far more
      of manner, politeness, and gentle quiet. She seems by nature to possess
      the highest animal spirits, but she appeared to me not happy. I thought
      she looked oppressed within, though there is a native cheerfulness about
      her which I fancy scarce ever deserts her. There is in her face,
      especially when she speaks, a sweetness of good-humour and obligingness,
      that seem to be the natural and instinctive qualities of her disposition;
      joined to an openness of countenance that announces her endowed, by
      nature, with a character intended wholly for honesty, fairness, and good
      purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She now conversed with me wholly, and in so soberly sensible and quiet a
      manner, as I had imagined incompatible with her powers. Too much and too
      little credit have variously been given her. About me and my health she
      was more civil than I can well tell you; not from prudery&mdash;I have
      none, in these records, methinks!&mdash;but from its being mixed into all
      that passed. We talked over my late tour, Bath waters, and the king&rsquo;s
      illness. This, which was led to by accident, was here a tender Subject,
      considering her heading the Regency squadron; however, I have only one
      line to pursue, and from that I can never vary. I spoke of my own deep
      distress from his sufferings without reserve, and of the distress of the
      queen with the most avowed compassion and respect. She was extremely
      well-bred in all she said herself, and seemed willing <span class="pagenum">428</span><a
      name="link428" id="link428"></a> to keep up the subject. I fancy no one
      has just in the same way treated it with her grace before; however, she
      took all in good part, though to have found me retired in discontent had
      perhaps been more congenial to her. But I have been sedulous to make them
      all know the contrary. Nevertheless, as I am eager to be considered apart
      from all party, I was much pleased, after all this, to have her express
      herself very desirous to keep up Our acquaintance, ask many questions as
      to the chance of my remaining in Bath, most politely hope to profit from
      it, and, finally, inquire my direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Elizabeth (Foster) has the character of being so alluring that Mrs.
      Holroyd told me it was the opinion Of Mr. Gibbon no man could withstand
      her, and that, if she chose to beckon the lord chancellor from his
      woolsack, in full sight of the world, he could not resist obedience!<a

    <h2>
      BISHOP PERCY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not long after our settling at Bath, I found, upon returning from the
      Pump-room, cards left for me of the Bishop of Dromore (Dr. Percy), Mrs.
      and the Miss Percys. I had met them formerly once at Miss Reynolds&rsquo;s,
      and once Visited them when Dr. Percy was Dean of Carlisle. The collector
      and editor of the beautiful reliques of ancient English poetry, I could
      not but be happy to again see. I returned the visit: they were out; but
      the bishop soon after came when I was at home. I had a pleasant little
      chat with him. The bishop is perfectly easy and unassuming, very
      communicative, and, though not very entertaining because too prolix, he is
      otherwise intelligent and of good commerce. Mrs. Percy is ill, and cannot
      make visits, though she sends her name and receives company at home. She
      is very uncultivated and ordinary in manners and conversation, but a good
      creature and much delighted to talk over the royal family, to one of whom
      she was formerly a nurse.

    <h2>
      THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE AGAIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three days before we left Bath, as I was coming with Mrs. Ord from the
      Pump-room, we encountered a chair from<span class="pagenum">429</span><a
      name="link429" id="link429"></a> which a lady repeatedly kissed her hand
      and bowed to me. I was too nearsighted to distinguish who she was, till,
      coming close, and a little stopped by more people, she put her face to the
      glass, and said &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do? How d&rsquo;ye do?&rdquo; and I
      recollected the Duchess of Devonshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      About an hour after I had again the honour of a visit from her, and with
      Lady dowager Spencer. I was luckily at home alone, Mrs Ord having
      dedicated the rest of the morning to her own visits. I received them,
      therefore, with great pleasure. I now saw the duchess far more easy and
      lively in her spirits, and, consequently, far more lovely in her person.
      Vivacity is so much her characteristic, that her style of beauty requires
      it indispensably; the beauty, indeed, dies away without it. I now saw how
      her fame for personal charms had been obtained; the expression of her
      smiles is so very sweet, and has an ingenuousness and openness so
      singular, that, taken in those moments, not the most rigid critic could
      deny the justice of her personal celebrity. She was quite gay, easy, and
      charming: indeed, that last epithet might have been coined for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This has certainly been a singular acquaintance for me that the first
      visit I should make after leaving the queen should be to meet the head of
      the opposition public, the Duchess of Devonshire!

      DR. BURNEY&rsquo;S CONVERSATION WITH MR. BURKE: REMARKS BY Miss BURNEY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I [Dr. Burney] dined with Sir Joshua last week, and met Mr. Burke,
      his brother, Mr. Malone, the venerable Bishop of St. Pol de Leonn, and a
      French abbe or chevalier. I found Mr. Burke in the room on my arrival, and
      after the first very cordial civilities were over, he asked me, with great
      eagerness, whether I thought he might go in his present dress to pay his
      respects to Miss Burney, and was taking up his hat, till I told him you
      were out of town. He imagined, I Suppose, you were in St. Martin&rsquo;s-street,
      where he used to call upon you. In talking over your health, the recovery
      of your liberty and of society, he said, if Johnson had been alive, your
      history would <span class="pagenum">430</span><a name="link430"
      id="link430"></a> have furnished him with an additional and interesting
      article to his &lsquo;Vanity of Human Wishes.&rsquo; He said he had never
      been more mistaken in his life. He thought the queen had never behaved
      more amiably, or shown more good sense, than in appropriating you to her
      service; but what a service had it turned out!&mdash;a confinement to such
      a companion as Mrs. Schwellenberg!&mdash;Here exclamations of severity and
      kindness in turn lasted a considerable time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever I see Mr. Burke where he speaks to me upon the subject, I will
      openly confide to him how impossible it was that the queen should conceive
      the subserviency expected, unjustly and unwarrantably, by Mrs.
      Schwellenberg: to whom I ought only to have belonged officially, and at
      official hours, unless the desire of further intercourse had been
      reciprocal. The queen had imagined that a younger and more lively
      colleague would have made her faithful old servant happier and that idea
      was merely amiable in her majesty, who could not Suspect the misery
      inflicted on that poor new colleague.

      LITERARY RECREATION.

    <p>
      Chelsea College, October&mdash;I have never been so pleasantly situated at
      home since I lost the sister of my heart and my most affectionate
      Charlotte. My father is almost constantly Within. Indeed, I now live with
      him wholly; he has himself appropriated me a place, a seat, a desk, a
      table, and every convenience and comfort, and he never seemed yet so
      earnest to keep me about him. We read together, write together, chat,
      compare notes, communicate projects, and diversify each other&rsquo;s
      employments. He is all goodness, gaiety, and affection; and his society
      and kindness are more precious to Me than ever. Fortunately, in this
      season of leisure and comfort, the spirit of composition proves active.
      The day is never long enough, and I Could employ two pens almost
      incessantly, in my scribbling what will not be repressed. This is a
      delight to my dear father inexpressibly great and though I have gone no
      further than to let him know, from time to time, the species of matter
      that occupies me, he is perfectly contented, and patiently waits till
      something is quite finished, before he insists upon reading a word. This
      &ldquo;suits my humour well,&rdquo; as my own industry is all gone when
      once its intent is produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest I have been going on with my third tragedy.<span
      class="pagenum">431</span><a name="link431" id="link431"></a> I have two
      written, but never yet have had opportunity to read them; which, of
      course, prevents their being corrected to the best of my power, and fitted
      for the perusal of less indulgent eyes; or rather of eyes less prejudiced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Believe me, my dear friends, in the present composed and happy state of my
      mind, I Could never have suggested these tales; but, having only to
      correct, combine, contract, and finish, I will not leave them undone. Not,
      however, to sadden myself to the same point in which I began them, I read
      more than I write, and call for happier themes from others, to enliven my
      mind from the dolorous sketches I now draw of my Own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The library or study, in which we constantly sit, supplies such delightful
      variety of food, that I have nothing to wish. Thus, my beloved sisters and
      friends, you see me, at length, enjoying all that peace, ease, and chosen
      recreation and employment, for which so long I sighed in vain, and which,
      till very lately, I had reason to believe, even since attained, had been
      allowed me too late. I am more and more thankful every night, every
      morning, for the change in my destiny, and present blessings of my lot;
      and you, my beloved Susan and Fredy, for whose prayers I have so often
      applied in my sadness, suffering, and despondence, afford me now the same

      SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDs&rsquo;s BLINDNESS.

    <p>
      November.-Another evening my father took me to Sir Joshua Reynolds. I had
      long languished to see that kindly zealous friend, but his ill health had
      intimidated me rom making the attempt; and now my dear father went up
      stairs alone, and inquired of Miss Palmer if her uncle was well enough to
      admit me. He returned for me immediately. I felt the utmost pleasure in
      again mounting his staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Palmer hastened forward and embraced me most cordially. I then shook
      hands with Sir Joshua. He had a bandage over one eye, and the other shaded
      with a green halfbonnet. He seemed serious even to sadness, though
      extremely kind. &ldquo;I am very glad,&rdquo; he said, in a meek voice and
      dejected accent, &ldquo;to see you again, and I wish I could see you
      better! but I have only one eye now,&mdash;and hardly that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was really quite touched. The expectation of total blind-<span
      class="pagenum">432</span><a name="link432" id="link432"></a> ness
      depresses him inexpressibly; not, however, inconceivably I hardly knew how
      to express either my concern for his altered situation since our meeting,
      or my joy in again being with him: but my difficulty was short; Miss
      Palmer eagerly drew me to herself, and recommended to Sir Joshua to go on
      with his cards. He had no spirit to oppose; probably, indeed, no
      inclination.
    </p>
    <p>
      One other time we called again, in a morning. Sir Joshua and his niece
      were alone, and that invaluable man was even more dejected than before.
      How grievous to me It is to see him thus changed!<a href="#linknote-352"

    <h2>
      AMONG OLD FRIENDS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      December.-I most gladly accepted an invitation to my good Mrs. Ord, to
      meet a circle of old friends. The day proved extremely pleasant. We went
      to dinner, my father and I, and met Mrs. Montagu, in good spirits, and
      very unaffectedly agreeable. No one was there to awaken ostentation, no
      new acquaintance to require any surprise from her powers; she was
      therefore natural and easy, as well as informing and entertaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Garrick embraced me again and again, to express a satisfaction in
      meeting me once more in this social way, that she would have thought it
      indecorous to express by words. I thanked her exactly in the same
      language; and, without a syllable being uttered, she said, &ldquo;I
      rejoice you are no longer a courtier!&rdquo; and I answered, &ldquo;I love
      you dearly for preferring me in my old state!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening we were joined by Lady Rothes,<a href="#linknote-353"
      name="linknoteref-353" id="linknoteref-353"><small>353</small></a> with
      whom I had my peace to make for a long-neglected letter upon my<span
      class="pagenum">433</span><a name="link433" id="link433"></a> &ldquo;restoration
      to society,&rdquo; as she termed it, and who was very lively and
      pleasant....
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pepys, who came just at that instant from Twickenham, which he
      advanced eagerly to tell me, talked of Mr. Cambridge, and his admirable
      wit and spirits, and Miss Cambridge, and her fervent friendship for me,
      and the charm and agreeability of the whole house, with an ardour so
      rapid, there scarce needed any reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Batt gave me a most kindly congratulatory bow upon his entrance. I
      knew his opinion of my retreat, and understood it: but I was encircled
      till the concluding part of the evening by the Pepys and Lady Rothes,
      etc.; and then Mr. Batt seated himself by my elbow, and began. &ldquo;How
      I rejoice,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;to see you at length out of thraldom!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thraldom?&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s rather a strong word!
      I assure you &rsquo;tis the first time I have heard it pronounced full and
      plumply.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, but,&rdquo; cried he, laughing, &ldquo;I may be allowed to say
      so, because you know my principles. You know me to be loyal; you could not
      stand it from an opposition-man&mdash;but saints may do much!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He is a professed personal friend of Mr. Pitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then began some exculpation of my late fatigues, assuring him they were
      the effect of a situation not understood, and not of any hardness of
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very probably,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;but I am glad you have ended
      them: I applaud&mdash;I honour the step you have taken. Those who suffer,
      yet still continue in fetters, I never pity;&mdash;there is a want of
      integrity, as well as spirit, in such submission.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those they serve,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;are not the persons to
      blame; they are commonly uninformed there is anything to endure, and
      believe all is repaid by the smiles so universally solicited.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;and it is that general base
      subservience that makes me struck with your opposite conduct.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My conduct,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;was very simple; though I
      believe it did not the less surprise; but it all consisted in not
      pretending, when I found myself sinking, to be swimming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He said many other equally good-natured things, and finished them with
      &ldquo;But what a pleasure it is to me to see you here in this manner,
      dressed no more than other people! I have not seen you these five years
      past but looking dressed out for the Drawing-room, or something as bad!&rdquo;
      <span class="pagenum">434</span><a name="link434" id="link434"></a> A
      SUMMONS FROM THE QUEEN.
    </p>
    <p>
      January.-I had a very civil note from Mrs. Schwellenberg telling me that
      Miss Goldsworthy was ill, which made Miss Gomme necessary to the
      princesses, and therefore, as Mlle. Jacobi was still lame, her majesty
      wished for my attendance On Wednesday noon. I received this little summons
      with very sincere pleasure, and sent a warm acknowledgment for its honour.
      I was engaged for the evening to Mr. Walpole, now Lord Orford, by my
      father, who promised to call for me at the Queen&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon I went thither, and saw, by the carriages, their majesties were
      just arrived from Windsor. In my way upstairs I encountered the Princess
      Sophia. I really felt a pleasure at her sight, so great that I believe I
      saluted her; I hardly know; but she came forward, with her hands held out,
      so good humoured and so sweetly, I was not much on my guard. How do I wish
      I had gone that moment to my royal mistress, while my mind was fully and
      honestly occupied with the most warm satisfaction in being called again
      into her presence!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess Sophia desired me to send her Miss Gomme, whom she said I
      should find in my own room. Thither I went, and we embraced very
      cordially; but she a little made me stare by saying, &ldquo;Do you sleep
      in your old bed?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I go home
      after dinner,&rdquo; and she said no more, but told me she must have two
      hours conference alone with me, from the multiplicity of things she had to
      discuss with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We parted then, and I proceeded to Mrs. Schwellenberg. There I was most
      courteously received, and told I was to go at night to the play. I replied
      I was extremely sorry, but I was engaged. She looked deeply displeased,
      and I was forced to offer to send an excuse. Nothing, however, was
      settled; she went to the queen, whither I was most eager to follow, but I
      depended upon her arrangement, and could not go uncalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to my own room, as they still call it, and Miss Gomme and Miss
      Planta both came to me. We had a long discourse upon matters and things.
      By and by Miss Gomme was called out to Princesses Mary and Amelia; she
      told them who was in the old apartment, and they instantly entered it.
      Princess Mary took my hand, and said repeatedly, &ldquo;My dear Miss
      Burney, how glad I am to see you again!&rdquo; and the lovely little
      Princess Amelia kissed me twice, with the sweetest air of <span
      class="pagenum">435</span><a name="link435" id="link435"></a> affection.
      This was a very charming meeting to me, and I expressed my real delight in
      being thus allowed to come amongst them again, in the strongest and truest
      terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been but a short time alone, when Westerhaults came to ask me if I
      had ordered my father&rsquo;s carriage to bring me from the play. I told
      him I was engaged but would give up that engagement, and endeavour to
      secure being fetched home after the play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schwellenberg then desired to see me. &ldquo;What you mean by going
      home?&rdquo; cried she, somewhat deridingly: &ldquo;know you not you might
      sleep here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was really thunderstruck; so weak still, and so unequal as I feel to
      undertake night and morning attendance, which I now saw expected. I was
      obliged, however, to comply; and I wrote a note to Sarah, and another note
      to be given to my father, when he called to take me to Lord Orford. But I
      desired we might go in chairs, and not trouble him for the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      This arrangement, and my dread of an old attendance I was so little fitted
      for renewing, had so much disturbed me before I was summoned to the queen,
      that I appeared before her without any of the glee and spirits with which
      I had originally obeyed her commands. I am still grieved at this
      circumstance, as it must have made me seem cold and insensible to herself,
      when I was merely chagrined at the peremptory mismanagement of her agent.
      Mr. de Luc was with her. She was gracious, but by no means lively or
      cordial. She was offended, probably,&mdash;and there was no reason to
      wonder, and yet no means to clear away the cause. This gave me much
      vexation, and the more I felt it the less I must have appeared to merit
      her condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, after she was dressed she honoured me with a summons to the
      White closet, where I presently felt as much at home as if I had never
      quitted the royal residence. She inquired into my proceedings, and I began
      a little history of my south-west tour, which she listened to till word
      was brought the king was come from the levee: dinner was then ordered, and
      I was dismissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At our dinner, the party, in the old style, was-Mr. de Luc, Miss Planta,
      Mrs. Stainforth, and Miss Gomme; Mrs. Schwellenberg was not well enough to
      leave her own apartment, except to attend the queen. We were gay enough, I
      own my spirits were not very low in finding myself a guest at that table,
      where <span class="pagenum">436</span><a name="link436" id="link436"></a>
      I was so totally unfit to be at home, and whence, nevertheless, I should
      have been very much and deeply concerned to have found myself excluded,
      since the displeasure of the queen could alone have procured such a
      banishment. Besides, to visit, I like the whole establishment, however
      inadequate I found them for supplying the place of all I quitted to live
      among them. O, who could succeed there?
    </p>
    <p>
      During the dessert the Princess Elizabeth came into the Tea room. I was
      very glad, by this means, to see all this lovely female tribe. As soon as
      she was gone I made off to prepare for the play, with fan, cloak-, and
      gloves. At the door of my new old room who should I encounter but Mr.
      Stanhope? He was all rapture, in his old way, at the meeting, and
      concluded me, I believe, reinstated. I got off as fast as possible, and
      had just shut myself in, and him out, when I heard the voice of the king,
      who passed my door to go to the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was quite chagrined to have left it so unseasonably, as my whole heart
      yearned to see him. He stayed but a minute, and I heard him stop close to
      my door, and speak with Mr. de Luc. The loudness of his voice assuring me
      he was saying nothing he meant to be unheard, I could not resist softly
      opening my door. I fancy he expected this, for he came up to me
      immediately, and with a look of goodness almost amounting to pleasure&mdash;I
      believe I may say quite&mdash;he inquired after my health, and its
      restoration, and said he was very glad to see me again. Then turning gaily
      to Mr. de Luc, &ldquo;And you, Mr. de Luc,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;are not
      you, too, very glad to see Miss Beurni again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him, very truly, the pleasure with which I had reentered his roof.&mdash;He
      made me stand near a lamp, to examine me, and pronounced upon my amended
      looks with great benevolence: and, when he was walking away, said aloud to
      Mr. de Luc, who attended him, &ldquo;I dare say she was very willing to
      come!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Our party in the box for the queen&rsquo;s attendants consisted of Lady
      Catherine Stanhope, Miss Planta, Major Price, Greville Upton, and Mr.
      Frank Upton. The king and queen and six princesses sat opposite. It was to
      me a lovely and most charming sight. The Prince of Wales, and the Duke of
      York and his bride, with the Duke of Clarence, sat immediately under us. I
      saw the duchess now and then, and saw that she has a very sensible and
      marked countenance, but no beauty. <span class="pagenum">437</span><a
      name="link437" id="link437"></a> She was extremely well received by the
      people, and smiled at in the most pleasing manner by her opposite new
      relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night I once more attended the queen, and it seemed as strange to me as
      if I had never done it before. The next day, Thursday, the queen gave up
      the Drawing-room, on account of a hurt on her foot. I had the honour of
      another very long conference in the White closet, in which I finished the
      account of my late travels, and during which, though she was very
      gracious, she was far less communicative than heretofore, saying little
      herself, and making me talk almost all. When I attended the queen again
      to-night, the strangeness was so entirely worn away, that it seemed to me
      as if I had never left my office! And so again on Friday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon the royal family set off for Windsor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen graciously sent for me before she went, to bid me good-bye, and
      condescended to thank me for my little services. I would have offered
      repetition with all my heart, but I felt my frame unequal to such
      business. Indeed I was half dead with only two days&rsquo; and nights&rsquo;
      exertion. &lsquo;Tis amazing how I ever went through all that is passed.

    <h2>
      MR. HASTINGS&rsquo;S DEFENCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Feb. 13.&mdash;I found a note from Mrs. Schwellenberg, with an offer of a
      ticket for Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s trial, the next day, if I wished to go to
      it. I did wish it exceedingly, no public subject having ever so deeply
      interested me; but I could not recollect any party I could join, and
      therefore I proposed to Captain Phillips to call on his Court friend, and
      lay before her my difficulty. He readily declared he would do more, for he
      would frankly ask her for a ticket for himself, and stay another day,
      merely to accompany me. You know well the kind pleasure and zeal with
      which he is always ready to discover and propose expedients in distress.
      His visit prospered, and we went to Westminster Hall together.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the managers attended at the opening, but the attendance of all others
      was cruelly slack. To hear the attack, the people came in crowds; to hear
      the defence, they scarcely came in tête-à-têtes! &lsquo;Tis barbarous
      there should be so much more pleasure given by the recital of guilt than
      by the vindication of innocence!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Law<a href="#linknote-354" name="linknoteref-354" id="linknoteref-354"><small>354</small></a>
      spoke the whole time; he made a general harangue <span class="pagenum">438</span><a
      name="link438" id="link438"></a> in answer to the opening general harangue
      of Mr. Burke, and he spoke many things that brought forward conviction in
      favour of Mr. Hastings; but he was terrified exceedingly, and this
      timidity Induced him to so frequently beg quarter from his antagonists,
      both for any blunders and any deficiencies, that I felt angry with even
      modest egotism, when I considered that it was rather his place to come
      forward with the shield and armour of truth, undaunted, and to have
      defied, rather than deprecated, the force of talents when without such
      support.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of the managers quitted their box, and I am uncertain whether or not
      any of them saw me. Mr. Windham, in particular, I feel satisfied either
      saw me not, or was so circumstanced, as manager, that he could not come to
      speak with me; for else, this my first appearance from the parental roof
      under which he has so largely contributed to replace me would have been
      the last time for his dropping my acquaintance. Mr. Sheridan I have no
      longer any ambition to be noticed by; and Mr. Burke, at this place, I am
      afraid I have already displeased, so unavoidably cold and frigid did I
      feel myself when he came here to me formerly. Anywhere else, I should
      bound forward to meet him, with respect, and affection, and gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening I went to the queen&rsquo;s house. I found Mrs.
      Schwellenberg, who instantly admitted me, at cards with Mr. de Luc. Her
      reception was perfectly kind; and when I would have given up the tickets,
      she told me they were the queen&rsquo;s, who desired, if I wished it, I
      would keep them for the season. This was a pleasant hearing upon every
      account, and I came away in high satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after, I went again to the trial, and took another captain for
      my esquire&mdash;my good and ever-affectionate James. The Hall was still
      more empty, both of Lords and Commons, and of ladies too, than the first
      day of this session. I am quite shocked at the little desire there appears
      to hear Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s defence.

    </div>
    <h2>
      DIVERSE VIEWS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the managers entered, James presently said, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Mr.
      Windham coming to speak to you.&rdquo; And he broke from the procession,
      as it was descending to its cell, to give me that pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      His inquiries about my health were not, as he said, merely common
      inquiries, but, without any other answer to them than a bow, I interrupted
      their course by quickly saying, &ldquo;You<span class="pagenum">439</span><a
      name="link439" id="link439"></a> have been excursioning and travelling all
      the world o&rsquo;er since I saw you last.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paid me in my own coin with only a bow, hastily going back to myself:
      &ldquo;But your tour,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;to the west, after all that-&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw what was following, and, again abruptly stopping him, &ldquo;But
      here you are returned,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;to all your old labours and
      toils again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried he, half laughing, &ldquo;not labours and
      toils always; they are growing into pleasures now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s being very good, very liberal, indeed,&rdquo; quoth I,
      supposing him to mean hearing the defence made the pleasure but he stared
      at me with so little concurrence, that, soon understanding he only meant
      bringing their charges home to the confusion of the culprit, I stared
      again a little while, and then said, &ldquo;You sometimes accuse me of
      being ambiguous; I think you seem so yourself, now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To nobody but you,&rdquo; cried he, with a rather reproachful
      accent. &ldquo;O, now,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;you are not ambiguous, and I
      am all the less pleased.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People,&rdquo; cried James, bonnement, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t like to
      be convinced.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hastings,&rdquo; said Mr. Windham, &ldquo;does not convince, he
      does not bring conviction home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to you,&rdquo; quoth I, returning his accent pretty fully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, true,&rdquo; answered he very candidly; &ldquo;there may be
      something in that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it all to be?&rdquo; cried James. &ldquo;Is the defence to
      go on long, and are they to have any evidence; or how?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know this part of the business,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Windham, smiling a little at such an upright downright question &ldquo;it
      is Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s affair now to settle it: however, I understand he
      means to answer charge after charge as they were brought against him,
      first by speeches, then by evidence: however, this is all conjecture.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      MR. LAW&rsquo;S SPEECH DISCUSSED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We then spoke of Mr. Law, Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s first counsel, and I
      expressed some dissatisfaction that such attackers should not have had
      abler and more equal opponents. <span class="pagenum">440</span><a
      name="link440" id="link440"></a> &ldquo;But do you not think Mr. Law spoke
      well?&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;clear, forcible?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not forcible,&rdquo; cried I. I would not say not clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was frightened,&rdquo; said Mr. Windham, &ldquo;he might not do
      himself justice. I have heard him elsewhere, and been very well satisfied
      with him; but he looked pale and alarmed, and his voice trembled.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very well content with his materials,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;which
      I thought much better than the use he made of them; and once or twice, he
      made an opening that, with a very little skill, might most adroitly and
      admirably have raised a laugh against you all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked a little askew, I must own, but he could not help smiling... I
      gave him an instance in point, which-was the reverse given by Mr. Law to
      the picture drawn by Mr. Burke of Tamerlane, in which he said those
      virtues and noble qualities bestowed upon him by the honourable manager
      were nowhere to be found but on the British stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this, seriously, with a very little ingenuity, might have placed Mr.
      Burke at the head of a company of comedians. This last notion I did not
      speak, however; but enough was understood, and Mr. Windham looked straight
      away from me, without answering; nevertheless, his profile, which he left
      me, showed much more disposition to laugh than to be incensed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore I proceeded; pointing out another lost opportunity that, well
      saved, might have proved happily ridiculous against them; and this was Mr.
      Law&rsquo;s description of the real state of India, even from its first
      discovery by Alexander, opposed to Mr. Burke&rsquo;s flourishing
      representation, of its golden age, its lambs and tigers associating, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he looked askew; but I believe he is truth itself, for he offered no
      defence, though, of course, he would not enter into the attack. And surely
      at this critical period I must not spare pointing out all he will submit
      to hear, on the side of a man of whose innocence I am so fully persuaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must own, however,&rdquo; continued I, finding him still
      attentive, though silent, &ldquo;Mr. Law provoked me in one point&mdash;his
      apologies for his own demerits. Why should he contribute his humble mite
      to your triumphs? and how little was it his place to extol your superior
      talents, as if you were not self-sufficient enough already, without his
      aid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Unless you had heard the speech of Mr. Law, you can hardly <span
      class="pagenum">441</span><a name="link441" id="link441"></a> imagine with
      what timid flattery he mixed every exertion he ventured to make in behalf
      of his client; and I could not forbear this little observation, because I
      had taken notice with what haughty derision the managers had perceived the
      fears of their importance, which were felt even by the very counsel of
      their prisoner. Mr. Windham, too, who himself never looks either insolent
      or deriding, must be sure what I meant for his associates could not
      include himself. He did not, however, perfectly welcome the remark; he
      still only gave me his profile, and said not a word,-so I went on. Mr.
      Hastings little thinks what a pleader I am become in his cause, against
      one of his most powerful adversaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was still another thing,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;in which I
      felt vexed with Mr. Law: how could he be so weak as to beg quarter from
      you, and to humbly hope that, if any mistake, any blunder, any improvident
      word escaped him, you would have the indulgence to spare your ridicule? O
      yes, to be sure! when I took notice at the moment of his supplication, and
      before any error committed, that every muscle of every face, amongst you
      was at work from the bare suggestion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not even pretend to look grave now, but, turning frankly towards
      me, said, &ldquo;Why, Mr. Fox most justly observed upon that petition,
      that, if any man makes a blunder, a mistake, &rsquo;tis very well to
      apologize: but it was singular to hear a man gravely preparing for his
      blunders and mistakes, and wanting to make terms for them beforehand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like him for this,&rdquo; cried James again bonnement, &ldquo;that
      he seems so much interested for his client.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give me leave to inquire,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;one
      thing? You know my old knack of asking strange questions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He only bowed&mdash;archly enough, I assure you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I fancy, or was it fact, that you were a flapper to Mr. Burke,
      when Mr. Law charged him with disingenuity, in not having recanted the
      accusation concerning Devy Sing? He appeared to me in much perturbation,
      and I thought by his see-saw he was going to interrupt the speech: did you
      prevent him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I did not; I did not think him
      in any danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rubbed his cheek, though, as he spoke, as if he did not much like that
      circumstance. O that Mr. Burke&mdash;so great, so noble a creature&mdash;can
      in this point thus have been warped.<span class="pagenum">442</span><a

    <h2>
      MR. WINDHAM ON THE FRENCH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I ran off to another scene, and inquired how he had been amused abroad,
      and, in particular, at the National Assembly?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;it was extremely curious for a
      short time; but there is little variety in it, and therefore it will not
      do long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in a humour to be just as sincere here, as about the trial; so you
      democrats must expect no better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;there is a great dearth of
      abilities in this new Assembly; how then should there be any variety?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I cannot say that: they do not want abilities; but they have no
      opportunity to make their way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O!&rdquo; quoth I, shaking my wise head, &ldquo;abilities, real
      abilities, make their own way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s true; but, in that Assembly, the noise, the
      tumult&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abilities,&rdquo; again quoth I, &ldquo;have power to quell noise
      and tumult.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, in general; but not in France. These new legislative
      members are so solicitous to speak, so anxious to be heard, that they
      prefer uttering any tautology to listening to others; and when once they
      have begun, they go on with what speed they may, and without selection,
      rather than stop. They see so many ready to seize their first pause, they
      know they have so little chance of a second hearing, that I never entered
      the Assembly without being reminded of the famous old story of the man who
      patiently bore hearing a tedious harangue, by saying the whole time to
      himself, &lsquo;Well, well, &rsquo;tis his turn now; but let him beware
      how he sneezes.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;A BARBAROUS BUSINESS!&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      James now again asked some question of their intentions with regard to the
      progress of the trial. He answered, &ldquo;We have nothing to do with its
      present state. We leave Mr. Hastings now to himself, and his own set. Let
      him keep to his cause, and he may say what he will. We do not mean to
      interfere, nor avail ourselves of our privileges.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hastings was just entered; I looked down at him, and saw his
      half-motion to kneel; I could not bear it, and, turning suddenly to my
      neighbour, &ldquo;O, Mr. Windham,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;after <span
      class="pagenum">443</span><a name="link443" id="link443"></a> all, &rsquo;tis,
      indeed, a barbarous business!&rdquo; This was rather further than I meant
      to go, for I said it with serious earnestness; but it was surprised from
      me by the emotion always excited at sight of that unmerited humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked full at me upon this solemn attack, and with a look of chagrin
      amounting to displeasure, saying, &ldquo;It is a barbarous business we
      have had to go through.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not attempt to answer this, for, except through the medium of sport
      and raillery, I have certainly no claim upon his patience. But, in another
      moment, in a tone very flattering, he said, &ldquo;I do not understand,
      nor can any way imagine, how you can have been thus perverted!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; quoth I, &ldquo;it is you who are perverted!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Law began his second oration, and Mr. Windham ran down to his
      cell. I fancy this was not exactly the conversation he expected upon my
      first enlargement. However, though it would very seriously grieve me to
      hurt or offend him, I cannot refuse my own veracity, nor Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s
      injuries, the utterance of what I think truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Law was far more animated and less frightened, and acquitted himself
      so as to merit almost as much eloge as, in my opinion, he had merited
      censure at the opening. It was all in answer to Mr. Burke&rsquo;s general
      exordium and attack.

      DEATH OF SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Upon the day of Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s death<a href="#linknote-355"
      name="linknoteref-355" id="linknoteref-355"><small>355</small></a> I was
      in my bed, with two blisters, and I did not hear of it till two days
      after. I shall enter nothing upon this Subject here; our current letters
      mentioned the particulars, and I am not desirous to retrace them. His loss
      is as universally felt as his merit is universally acknowledged, and,
      joined to all public motives, I had myself private ones of regret that
      cannot subside. He was always peculiarly kind to me, and he had worked at
      my deliverance from a life he conceived too laborious for me as if I had
      been his own daughter; yet, from the time of my coming forth, I only twice
      saw him. I had not recovered strength for visiting before he was past
      receiving me. I grieve inexpressibly never to have been able to make him
      the small tribute of thanks for his most kind exertions in my cause. I
      little thought the second time I saw him would be my last opportunity, and
      my intention was to wait some favourable opening. <span class="pagenum">444</span><a
      name="link444" id="link444"></a> Miss Palmer is left heiress,<a

      and her unabating attendance upon her inestimable uncle in his sickroom
      makes everybody content with her great acquisition. I am sure she loved
      and admired him with all the warmth of her warm heart. I wrote her a few
      lines of condolence, and she has sent me a very kind answer. She went
      immediately to the Burkes, with whom she will chiefly, I fancy, associate.
    </p>
    <p>
      March.-Sad for the loss of Sir Joshua, and all of us ill ourselves, we
      began this month. Upon its 3rd day was his funeral.<a href="#linknote-357"

      Academy, professors and students, and all the Literary club, attended as
      family, mourners. Mr. Burke, Mr. Malone, and Mr. Metcalf, are executors.
      Miss Palmer has spared nothing, either in thought or expense, that could
      render the last honours splendid and grateful. It was a very melancholy
      day to us; though it had the alleviation and softening of a letter from
      our dear Charlotte, promising to arrive the next day.

    <h2>
      MR. WINDHAM TWITTED ON His LACK OF COMPASSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      April 23.&mdash;-I thought myself equal to again going to the trial, which
      recommenced, after six or seven weeks&rsquo; cessation, on account of the
      judges going the circuit. Sarah went with me: I am now so known in the
      chamberlain&rsquo;s box that the door-keepers and attendants make way for
      me without looking at my ticket. And to be sure, the managers on one side,
      and Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s friends and counsel on the other, must pretty
      well have my face by heart. I have the faces of all them, most certainly,
      in full mental possession; and the figures of many whose names I know not
      are so familiar to my eyes, that should I chance hereafter to meet them, I
      shall be apt to take them for old acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was again a full appearance of managers to accompany<span
      class="pagenum">445</span><a name="link445" id="link445"></a> Mr. Burke in
      his entry; and again Mr. Windham quitted the procession, as it descended
      to the box, and filed off to speak with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made the most earnest inquiries after the health of my dearest father,
      as well as after my own. He has all the semblance of real regard and
      friendship for us, and I am given to believe he wears no semblance that
      has not a real and sympathetic substance couched beneath. His manner
      instantly revived in my mind my intent not to risk, with him, the loss of
      making those poor acknowledgments for his kindness, that I so much regret
      omitting to Sir Joshua Reynolds. In return to his inquiries about my
      renovating health, I answered that I had again been very ill since I saw
      him last, and added, &ldquo;Indeed, I believe I did not come away too
      soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;I cannot resist giving myself the
      pleasure of making my acknowledgments for what I owe to you upon this
      subject. I have been, indeed, very much obliged, by various things that
      have come round to me, both to you and Sir Joshua.&mdash;O what a loss is
      that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a wretched loss!&rdquo; cried he: and we then united our
      warmest suffrages in his favour, with our deepest regret for our
      deprivation. Here I observed poor Mr. Hastings was brought in. I saw he
      was fixing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can you,&rdquo; I cried, fixing him, &ldquo;can you have so
      much compassion for one captive, and still have none for another?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you, then, still,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;the same sentiments?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;heard all thus far of the defence,
      and are you still unmoved?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unmoved?&rdquo; cried he, emphatically; &ldquo;shall I be moved by
      a lion? You see him there in a cage, and pity him; look back to when you
      might have seen him with a lamb in his claws!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I could only look dismayed for a moment. &ldquo;But, at least,&rdquo; I
      said, &ldquo;I hope what I hear is not true, though I now grow afraid to
      ask?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is anything about me,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;it is
      certainly not true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am extremely glad, indeed,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;for it has been
      buzzed about in the world that you were to draw up the final charge. This
      I thought most cruel of all; You, who have held back all this time&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! pretty completely,&rdquo; interrupted he, laughing. <span
      class="pagenum">446</span><a name="link446" id="link446"></a> &ldquo;No,
      not completely,&rdquo; I continued; &ldquo;but Yet YOU have made no direct
      formal speech, nor have come forward in any positive and formidable
      manner; therefore, as we have now heard all the others, and&mdash;almost
      enough&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to stop a moment, to see how this adventurous plainness was
      taken; and he really, though my manner showed me only rallying, looked I
      don&rsquo;t know how, at such unexampled disrespect towards his brother
      orators. But I soon went quietly on: &ldquo;To come forth now, after all
      that has passed, with the eclat of novelty, and,-for the most cruel part
      of all,&mdash;that which cannot be answered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis bringing a fresh
      courser into the field of battle, just as every other is completely jaded?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;that I am very generous to wish
      against what I should so much wish for, but for other considerations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, what a flattering way,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;of stating it!
      however, I can bear to allow you a little waste of compliments, which you
      know so well how to make; but I cannot bear to have you waste your
      compassion.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A POINT OF CEREMONIAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      May.&mdash;The 1st of this month I went again to Westminster Hall, with
      our cousin Elizabeth. Evidence was brought forward by the counsel for Mr.
      Hastings, and Lord Stormont was called upon as a witness. This produced
      some curious debating among the Lords, and with the chancellor. They spoke
      only for the ears of one another, as it was merely to settle some
      ceremonial, whether he was to be summoned to the common place where the
      witnesses stood, or had the claim of a peer to speak in his place, robed.
      This latter prevailed: and then we expected his speech; but no, a new
      debate ensued, which, as we gathered from the rumour about us, was that
      his lordship should have the prayer book, for his oath, belonging to the
      House of Peers. Here, also, his dignity was triumphant, though it cost the
      whole assembly a full quarter of an hour; while another prayer book was
      officially at hand, in the general post for plebeian witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well! aristocrat as I am, compared with you, I laughed heartily at all
      this mummery, and yet it was possibly wise, at this period of pulling down
      all law and order, all privilege and subordination, however frivolous was
      its appearance. <span class="pagenum">447</span><a name="link447"
      id="link447"></a> His testimony was highly favourable to Mr. Hastings,
      with regard to authenticating the intelligence he had received of an
      opening war with France, upon which hung much justification of the
      measures Mr. Hastings had pursued for raising supplies.

      Thence I went to the Queen&rsquo;s house, where-I have a most cordial
      general invitation from Mrs. Schwellenberg to go by all opportunities; and
      there is none so good as after the trial, that late hour exactly according
      With her dinner-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is just as she Was with respect to health; but in all other respects,
      how amended! all civility, all obligingness, all courtesy! and so desirous
      to have me visit her, that she presses me to come incessantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      During coffee, the princess royal came into the room. She condescended to
      profess herself quite glad to see me; and she had not left the room five
      minutes before, again returning, she said, &ldquo;Mrs. Schwellenberg, I am
      come to plague you, for I am come to take away Miss Burney.&rdquo; I give
      you leave to guess whether this plagued me.
    </p>
    <p>
      May 2.&mdash;The following week I again went to Westminster Hall. Mlle.
      Jacobi had made a point of accompanying me, that she might see the show,
      as James called it to General Burgoyne, and I had great pleasure in taking
      her, for she is a most ingenuous and good creature, though&mdash;alas!&mdash;by
      no means the same undaunted, gay, open character as she appeared at first.
      Sickness, confinement, absence from her friends, submission to her
      coadjutrix, and laborious watching have much altered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial of this day was all written evidence in favour of Mr. Hastings,
      and violent quarrelling as to its admissibility on the part of Mr. Burke.
      Mr. Windham took his place, during some part of the controversy, and spoke
      ably and clearly as to the given point in dispute, but with the most
      palpable tremor and internal struggle.

    <h2>
      A LONG TALK WITH THE KING AND QUEEN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I attended Mlle. Jacobi to the Queen&rsquo;s house, where I dined; and
      great indeed was my pleasure, during coffee, to see the Princess
      Elizabeth, who, In the most Pleasing manner <span class="pagenum">448</span><a
      name="link448" id="link448"></a> and the highest spirits, came to summon
      me to the queen. I found her majesty again with all her sweet daughters
      but the youngest. She was gracious and disposed to converse.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had a great deal of talk upon public concerns, and she told me a friend
      Of mine had spoken very well the day before, and so had Mr. Burke. She
      meant Mr. Windham. It was against the new associates, and in favour of the
      proclamation.<a href="#linknote-358" name="linknoteref-358"
      id="linknoteref-358"><small>358</small></a> Mr. Burke, of course, would
      here come forth in defence of his own predictions and opinions; but Mr.
      Windham, who had rather abided hitherto with Charles Fox, in thinking Mr.
      Burke too extreme, well as he loves him personally, was a new convert
      highly acceptable. He does not, however, go all lengths with Mr. Burke; he
      is only averse to an unconstitutional mode of reform, and to sanctioning
      club powers, so as to enable them, as in France, to overawe the state and
      senate.<a href="#linknote-359" name="linknoteref-359" id="linknoteref-359"><small>359</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after, to my infinite joy, the king entered. O, he spoke to me so
      kindly!&mdash;he congratulated me on the better looks which his own
      presence and goodness gave me, repeatedly declaring he had never seen me
      in such health. He asked me after my father, and listened with interest
      when I mentioned his depression, and told him that all he had done of late
      to soothe his retirement and pain had been making canons to solemn words,
      and with such difficulties of composition as, in better health and
      spirits, would have rather proved oppressive and perplexing than a relief
      to his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; said the king, after a very serious pause, &ldquo;have
      myself sometimes found, when ill or disturbed, that some grave and even
      difficult employment for my thoughts has tended more to compose me than
      any of the supposed usual relaxations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He also condescended to ask after little Norbury, taking off the eager
      little fellow while he spoke, and his earnest manner of delivery. He then
      Inquired about my friends Mr. and Mrs. Locke, and their expectations of
      the return of <span class="pagenum">449</span><a name="link449"
      id="link449"></a> William. He inquired how I live, whom I saw, what sort
      of neighbours I had in the college, and many other particulars, that
      seemed to desire to know how I went on, and whether I was comfortable. His
      looks, I am sure, said so, and most sweetly and kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They kept me till they went to the Japan room, where they meet the
      officers and ladies who attend them in public. They were going to the
      Ancient Music.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dear king, nobly unsuspicious where left to himself, and where he has
      met no doubleness, spoke also very freely of some political matters before
      me&mdash;of the new association in particular. It gratified me highly.

      who are in town for a few weeks. Miss Mary is sensible, and quick, and
      agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      They give a very unpleasant account of Madame de Genlis, or de Sillery, or
      Brulard, as she is now called.<a href="#linknote-361"
      name="linknoteref-361" id="linknoteref-361"><small>361</small></a> They
      say she has established herself at Bury, in their neighbourhood, with
      Mlle. la Princesse d&rsquo;Orleans and Pamela, and a Circe, and another<span
      class="pagenum">450</span><a name="link450" id="link450"></a> young girl
      under her care. They have taken a house, the master of which always dines
      with them, though Mrs. Young says he is such a low man he should not dine
      with her daughter. They form twenty with themselves and household. They
      keep a botanist, a chemist, and a natural historian always with them.
      These are supposed to have been common servants of the Duke of Orleans in
      former days, as they always walk behind the ladies when abroad; but, to
      make amends in the new equalising style, they all dine together at home.
      They visit at no house but Sir Thomas Gage&rsquo;s, where they carry their
      harps, and frequently have music. They have been to Bury ball, and danced
      all night Mlle. d&rsquo;Orleans with anybody, known or unknown to Madame
      Brulard.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a woeful change from that elegant, amiable, high-bred Madame de
      Genlis I knew six years ago! the apparent pattern of female perfection in
      manners, conversation, and delicacy.

    <p>
      There are innumerable democrats assembled in Suffolk; among them the

      THE WEEPING BEAUTY AGAIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      May 25.&mdash;This morning I went to a very fine public breakfast, given
      by Mrs. Montagu.... The crowd of company was such that we could only
      slowly make way, in any part. There could not be fewer than four or five
      hundred people. It was like a full Ranelagh by daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now met Mrs. Porteus, and who should be with her but the poor pretty
      S.S., whom so long I had not seen, and who has now lately been finally
      given up by her long-sought and very injurious lover, Dr. Vyse? She is
      sadly faded, and looked disturbed and unhappy; but still beautiful, though
      no longer blooming; and still affectionate, though absent and evidently
      absorbed. We had a little chat together about the Thrales. In mentioning
      our former intimacy with them, &ldquo;Ah, those,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;were
      happy times!&rdquo; and her eyes glistened, poor thing! hers has been a
      lamentable story!&mdash;-Imprudence and vanity have rarely been mixed with
      so much sweetness, and good-humour, and candour, and followed with more
      reproach and ill success. We agreed to renew acquaintance next winter; at
      present she will be little more in town. <span class="pagenum">451</span><a

    <h2>
      MADAME DE LA FITE AND MRS. HASTINGS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We went then round the rooms, which were well worth examination and
      admiration; and we met friends and acquaintance every other step.... While
      we were examining the noble pillars in the new room, I heard an
      exclamation of &ldquo;Est-ce possible? suis-je si heureuse?&mdash;Est-ce
      ma chere Mlle. Beurni que je vois?"<a href="#linknote-362"
      name="linknoteref-362" id="linknoteref-362"><small>362</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Need I say this was Madame de la, Fite? or Mrs. Fitt, as, since the French
      Revolution, of which she is a favourer, she is called by some of the
      household to which I belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke so as to moderate this rapture into something less calling for
      attention, which her voice and manner were engaging, not unwillingly. I
      had not seen her since my retreat, and, if she had been less pompous, I
      should have been glad of the meeting. She kept my hand close grasped
      between both her own, (though her fan nipped one of my fingers till I was
      ready to make faces,) with a most resolute empressement, to the great
      inconvenience of those who wanted to pass, for we were at one of the
      entrances into the great new room; and how long she might have continued
      this fond detention I know not, if a lady, whose appearance vied for show
      and parade with Madame de la Fite&rsquo;s manner and words, had not called
      out aloud, &ldquo;I am extremely happy indeed to see Miss Burney!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Mrs. Hastings; and to answer her I was let loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always been very sorry that Mrs. Hastings, who is a pleasing,
      lively, and well-bred woman, with attractive manners and attentions to
      those she wishes to oblige, should have an indiscretion so peculiarly
      unsuited to her situation, as to aim always at being the most conspicuous
      figure wherever she appears. Her dress now was like that of an Indian
      princess, according to our ideas of such ladies, and so much the most
      splendid, from its ornaments, and style, and fashion, though chiefly of
      muslin, that everybody else looked under-dressed in her presence. It is
      for Mr. Hastings I am sorry when I see this inconsiderate vanity, in a
      woman who would so much better manifest her sensibility of his present
      hard disgrace, by a modest and quiet appearance and demeanour.<span
      class="pagenum">452</span><a name="link452" id="link452"></a> THE
      IMPETUOUS ORATOR.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday, May 30.&mdash;To-day I went to Westminster Hall again, to hear
      the evidence of Mr. Markham, which is so pleasantly in favour of Mr.
      Hastings, that all the friends of that persecuted man are gratified by all
      he deposes. Miss Ord accompanied me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the impetuous and ungovernable Mr. Burke was Interrupting the
      chancellor, in order to browbeat Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s evidence, Mr.
      Windham involuntarily exclaimed, &ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; just as if he had
      been at his elbow, and playing the kind part of a flapper. I could not
      help laughing, and half joining him: he echoed back my laugh, and with a
      good humour that took in all its meaning and acknowledged its sympathy
      with regard to Mr. Burke, nevertheless, he spoke not a word. Afterwards,
      however, he spoke when I had far rather he had been silent, for he went to
      the assistance of Mr. Burke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael Angelo Taylor spoke also; but I observed with pleasure a
      distinction the chancellor made to Mr. Windham; for, when he answered
      their arguments, he singled him out as the person who had said what alone
      he meant upon that question to notice, by saying, &ldquo;The honourable
      manager who spoke second.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But I am sure&mdash;I think so, at least&mdash;Mr. Windham as little
      approves the violence of Mr. Burke in this trial as I do myself. I see him
      evidently and frequently suffer great pain and mortification when he is so
      obstreperous.

    <h2>
      BOSWELL&rsquo;S MIMICRY OF DR. JOHNSON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      June 1.&mdash;This day had been long engaged for breakfasting with Mrs.
      Dickenson and dining with Mrs. Ord. The breakfast guests were Mr. Langton,
      Mr. Foote, Mr. Dickenson, jun., a cousin, and a very agreeable and
      pleasing man; Lady Herries, Miss Dickenson, another cousin, and Mr.
      Boswell.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last was the object of the morning. I felt a strong sensation of that
      displeasure which his loquacious communications of every weakness and
      infirmity of the first and greatest good man of these times has awakened
      in me, at his first sight; and, though his address to me was courteous in
      the extreme, and he made a point of sitting next me, I felt an indignant
      disposition to a nearly forbidding reserve and silence. How <span
      class="pagenum">453</span><a name="link453" id="link453"></a> many starts
      of passion and prejudice has he blackened into record, that else might
      have sunk, for ever forgotten, under the preponderance of weightier
      virtues and excellences!
    </p>
    <p>
      Angry, however, as I have long been with him, he soon insensibly
      conquered, though he did not soften me: there is so little of ill-design
      or ill-nature in him, he is so open and forgiving for all that is said in
      return, that he soon forced me to consider him in a less serious light,
      and change my resentment against his treachery into something like
      commiseration of his levity; and before we parted we became good friends.
      There is no resisting great good humour, be what will in the opposite
      scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entertained us all as if hired for that purpose, telling stories of Dr.
      Johnson, and acting them with incessant buffoonery. I told him frankly
      that, if he turned him into ridicule by caricature, I should fly the
      premises: he assured me he would not, and indeed his imitations, though
      comic to excess, were so far from caricature that he omitted a thousand
      gesticulations which I distinctly remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Langton told some stories himself in imitation of Dr. johnson; but
      they became him less than Mr. Boswell, and only reminded me of what Dr.
      Johnson himself once said to me&mdash;&ldquo;Every man has, some time in
      his life, an ambition to be a wag.&rdquo; If Mr. Langton had repeated
      anything from his truly great friend quietly, it would far better have
      accorded with his own serious and respectable character.

    <h2>
      THE KING&rsquo;S BIRTHDAY.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      June 4.&mdash;The birthday of our truly good king.
    </h3>
    <p>
      As his majesty had himself given me, when I saw him after the queen&rsquo;s
      birthday, an implied reproach for not presenting myself at the palace that
      day, I determined not to incur a similar censure on this, especially as I
      hold my admission on such a national festival as a real happiness, as well
      as honour, when it is to see themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      How different was my attire from every other such occasion the five
      preceding years! It was a mere simple dressed undress, without feathers,
      flowers, hoop, or furbelows.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I alighted at the porter&rsquo;s lodge I was stopped from crossing
      the court-yard by seeing the king with his three sons, the Prince of
      Wales, Duke of York, and Duke of Clarence, who were standing there after
      alighting from their horses, to <span class="pagenum">454</span><a
      name="link454" id="link454"></a> gratify the people who encircled the iron
      rails. It was a pleasant and goodly sight, and I rejoiced in such a
      detention.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a terrible difficulty to find a friend who would make known to her
      majesty that I was come to pay my devoirs. At length, while watching in
      the passages to and fro, I heard a step upon the princesses&rsquo; stairs,
      and, venturing forward, I encountered the Princess Elizabeth. I paid my
      respectful congratulations on the day, which she most pleasantly received,
      and I intimated my great desire to see her majesty. I am Sure the amiable
      princess communicated my petition, for Mr. de Luc came out in a few
      minutes and ushered me into the royal presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen was in her state dressing-room, her head attired for the
      Drawing-room superbly; but her Court-dress, as usual, remaining to be put
      on at St. James&rsquo;s. She had already received all her early
      complimenters, and was prepared to go to St. James&rsquo;s: the princess
      royal was seated by her side, and all the other princesses, except the
      Princess Amelia, were in the room, with the Duchess of York. Mr. de Luc,
      Mrs. Schwellenberg, Madame de la Fite, and Miss Goldsworthy were in the
      background.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen smiled upon me most graciously, and every princess came up
      separately to speak with me. I thanked her majesty warmly for admitting me
      upon such an occasion, &ldquo;O!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;I resolved to
      see you the moment I knew you were here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She then inquired when I went into Norfolk, and conversed upon my summer
      plans, etc., with more of her original sweetness of manner than I have
      seen since my resignation. What pleasure this gave me! and what pleasure
      did I feel in being kept by her till the further door opened, and the king
      entered, accompanied by the Dukes of York and Clarence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I motioned to retreat, but calling out, &ldquo;What, Miss Burney,&rdquo;
      the king came up to me and inquired how I did, and began talking to me so
      pleasantly, so gaily, so kindly even, that I had the satisfaction of
      remaining and of gathering courage to utter my good wishes and warm
      fervent prayers for this day. He deigned to hear me very benignly; or make
      believe he did, for I did not make my harangue very audibly; but he must
      be sure of its purport.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said I was grown &ldquo;quite fat&rdquo; since he had seen me, and
      appealed to the Duke of York: he protested my arm was half as big again as
      heretofore, and then he measured it with his <span class="pagenum">455</span><a
      name="link455" id="link455"></a> spread thumbs and forefingers; and the
      whole of his manner showed his perfect approbation of the step I had
      taken, of presenting myself in the royal presence on this auspicious day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen soon after walked up to me, and asked if I should like to see
      the ball at night. I certainly should much like to have seen them &ldquo;in
      all their glory,&rdquo; after seeing them thus in all their kindness, as
      well as to have been present at the first public appearance at Court of
      the Princess Sophia: but I had no means to get from and to Chelsea so late
      at night, and was, therefore, forced to excuse myself, and decline her
      gracious proposition of giving me tickets.

    <p>
      Two days after, I went again to Westminster Hall with Miss Ord. Her good
      mother has a ticket for the Duke of Newcastle&rsquo;s box, in which she
      was seated. This-day&rsquo;s business consisted of examining witnesses: it
      was meant for the last meeting during this session but when it was over,
      Mr. Hastings arose and addressed the Lords in a most noble and pathetic
      speech, praying them to continue their attendance till his defence was
      heard throughout, or, at least, not to deny him the finishing his answer
      to the first charge.

    <p>
      He spoke, I believe, to the hearts of everybody, except his prosecutors:
      the whole assembly seemed evidently affected by what he urged, upon the
      unexampled delay of justice in his trial: silence was never more profound
      than that which his voice instantly commanded. Poor unhappy, injured
      gentleman! How, how can such men practise cruelty so glaring as is
      manifested in the whole conduct of this trial!
    </p>
    <p>
      From hence, as usual, I went to dine at the Queen&rsquo;s house. Mrs.
      Schwellenberg took me to the queen after coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was writing to Lady Cremorne: she talked with me while she finished
      her letter, and then read it to me, exactly as in old times. She writes
      with admirable facility, and peculiar elegance of expression, as well as
      of handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked me, somewhat curiously, if I had seen any of my old friends? I
      found she meant oppositionists. I told her only at the trial. She kept me
      in converse till the dear king came into the room: he had a grandson of
      Lord Howe&rsquo;s with him, a little boy in petticoats, with whom he was
      playing, and whom he thought remembered me, I had seen him frequently
      <span class="pagenum">456</span><a name="link456" id="link456"></a> at
      Weymouth, and the innocent little fellow insisted upon Making me his bows
      and reverences, when told to Make them to the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king asked me what had been doing at Westminster Hall? I repeated poor
      Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s remonstrance, particularly a part of it in which he
      had mentioned that he had already &ldquo;appealed to his majesty, whose
      justice he could not doubt.&rdquo; The king looked a little queer, but I
      was glad of the opportunity of putting in a word for poor Mr. Hastings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went on regularly to the trial till it finished for this year. Mr.
      Dallas closed his answer to the first charge, with great spirit and
      effect, and seemed to make numerous Proselytes for Mr. Hastings.

    <h2>
      A WELL-PRESERVED BEAUTY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thursday, June 18.&mdash;After many invitations and regulations, it was
      settled I was to accompany my father on a visit of three days to Mrs.
      Crewe at Hampstead. The villa at Hampstead is small, but commodious. We
      were received by Mrs. Crewe with much kindness. The room was rather dark,
      and she had a veil to her bonnet, half down, and with this aid she looked
      still in a full blaze of beauty. I was wholly astonished. Her bloom,
      perfectly natural, is as high as that of Augusta Locke when in her best
      looks, and the form of her face is so exquisitely perfect that my eye
      never Met it without fresh admiration. She is certainly, in my eyes, the
      most completely a beauty of any woman I ever saw. I know not, even now,
      any female in her first youth who could bear the comparison. She uglifies
      everything near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son was with her. He is just of age, and looks like her elder brother!
      He is a heavy old-looking young Man. He is going to China with Lord
      Macartney.<a href="#linknote-363" name="linknoteref-363"

    <h2>
      THE BURKES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My former friend, young Burke, was also there. I was glad to renew
      acquaintance with him though I could see some little strangeness in him:
      this, however, completely wore off. <span class="pagenum">457</span><a
      name="link457" id="link457"></a> before the day was over. Soon after
      entered Mrs. Burke, Miss F.,<a href="#linknote-364" name="linknoteref-364"
      id="linknoteref-364"><small>364</small></a> a niece, and Mr. Richard
      Burke, the comic, humorous, bold, queer brother of the Mr. Burke, who,
      they said, was soon coming, with Mr. Elliot. The Burke family were invited
      by Mrs. Crewe to meet us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Burke was just what I have always seen her, soft, gentle, reasonable,
      and obliging; and we met, I think, upon as good terms as if so many years
      had not parted us.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Mr. Burke appeared, accompanied by Mr. Elliot. He shook hands
      with my father as soon as he had paid his devoirs to Mrs. Crewe, but he
      returned my curtsey with so distant a bow, that I concluded myself quite
      lost with him, from my evident solicitude in poor Mr. Hastings&rsquo;s
      cause. I could not wish that less obvious, thinking as I think of it; but
      I felt infinitely grieved to lose the favour of a man whom in all other
      articles, I so much venerate, and whom, Indeed, I esteem and admire as the
      very first man of true genius now living in this Country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crewe introduced me to Mr. Elliot: I am Sure we were already
      personally known to each other, for I have seen him perpetually in the
      managers&rsquo; box, whence, as often, he must have seen me in the great
      chamberlain&rsquo;s. He is a tall, thin young man, plain in face, dress,
      and manner, but sensible, and possibly much besides; he was reserved,
      however, and little else appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment I was named, to my great joy I found Mr. Burke had not
      recollected me. He is more near-sighted, considerably, than myself.
      &ldquo;Miss Burney!&rdquo; he now exclaimed, coming forward, and quite
      kindly taking my hand, &ldquo;I did not see you;&rdquo; and then he spoke
      very sweet words of the meeting, and of my looking far better than &ldquo;while
      I was a courtier,&rdquo; and of how he rejoiced to see that I so little
      suited that station. &ldquo;You look,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;quite
      renewed, revived, disengaged; you seemed, when I conversed with you last,
      at the trial, quite altered; I never saw such a change for the better as
      quitting a Court has brought about!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! thought I, this is simply a mistake, from reasoning according to your
      own feelings. I only seemed altered for the worse at the trial, because I
      there looked coldly and distantly, from distaste and disaffection to your
      proceedings; and I here<span class="pagenum">458</span><a name="link458"
      id="link458"></a> look changed for the better, only because I here meet
      you without the chill of disapprobation, and with the glow of my first
      admiration of you and your talents!

    <h2>
      BURKE&rsquo;S CONVERSATIONAL POWERS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crewe gave him her place, and he sat by me, and entered into a most
      animated conversation upon Lord Macartney and his Chinese expedition, and
      the two Chinese youths who were to accompany it. These last he described
      minutely and spoke of the extent of the undertaking in high, and perhaps
      fanciful, terms, but with allusions and anecdotes intermixed, so full of
      general information and brilliant ideas, that I soon felt the whole of my
      first enthusiasm return, and with it a sensation of pleasure that made the
      day delicious to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this my father joined us, and politics took the lead. He spoke then
      with an eagerness and a vehemence that instantly banished the graces,
      though it redoubled the energies, of his discourse. &ldquo;The French
      Revolution,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which began by authorising and
      legalising Injustice, and which by rapid steps had proceeded to every
      species of despotism except owning a despot, was now menacing all the
      universe and all mankind with the most violent concussion of principle and
      order.&rdquo; My father heartily joined, and I tacitly assented to his
      doctrines, though I feared not with his fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Speech I Must repeat, for it is explanatory of his conduct, and nobly
      explanatory. When lie had expatiated upon the present dangers, even to
      English liberty and property, from the contagion of havoc and novelty, he
      earnestly exclaimed, &ldquo;This it is that has made ME an abettor and
      supporter of kings! Kings are necessary, and if we would preserve peace
      and prosperity, we must preserve THEM we must all put our shoulders to the
      work! Ay, and stoutly, too!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This subject lasted till dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner Mr. Burke sat next Mrs. Crewe, and I had the happiness to be
      seated next Mr. Burke, and my other neighbour was his amiable son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner, and the dessert when the servants were removed, were
      delightful. How I wish my dear Susanna and Fredy could meet this wonderful
      man when he is easy, happy, and with people he cordially likes! But
      politics, even on his own <span class="pagenum">459</span><a name="link459"
      id="link459"></a> side, must always be excluded; his irritability Is so
      terrible on that theme that it gives immediately to his face the
      expression of a man who is going to defend himself from murderers. I can
      give you only a few little detached traits of what passed, as detail would
      be endless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Fox being mentioned, Mrs. Crewe told us that he had lately said,
      upon being shown some passage in Mr. Burke&rsquo;s book which he had
      warmly opposed, but which had, in the event, made its own justification,
      very candidly, &ldquo;Well! Burke is right&mdash;but Burke is often right,
      only he is right too soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had Fox seen some things in that book,&rdquo; answered Mr. Burke,
      &ldquo;as soon, he would at this moment, in all probability, be first
      minister of this country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Crewe, &ldquo;with Pitt?&mdash;No!&mdash;no!&mdash;Pitt
      won&rsquo;t go out, and Charles Fox will never make a coalition with Pitt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; said Mr. Burke, dryly; &ldquo;why not this
      coalition as well as other coalitions?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody tried to answer this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles Fox, however,&rdquo; said Mr. Burke afterwards, &ldquo;can
      never internally like the French Revolution. He is entangled; but, in
      himself, if he should find no other objection to it, he has at least too
      much taste for such a revolution.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Elliot related that he had lately been in a company of some of the
      first and most distinguished men of the French nation, now fugitives here,
      and had asked them some questions about the new French ministry; they had
      answered that they knew them not even by name till now! &ldquo;Think,&rdquo;
      cried he, &ldquo;what a ministry that must be! Suppose a new
      administration formed here of Englishmen of whom we had never before heard
      the names! what statesmen they must be! how prepared and fitted for
      government! To begin by being at the helm!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Richard Burke related, very comically, various censures cast upon his
      brother, accusing him of being the friend of despots, and the abettor of
      slavery, because he had been shocked at the imprisonment of the king of
      France, and was anxious to preserve our own limited monarchy in the same
      state in which it so long had flourished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burke looked half alarmed at his brother&rsquo;s opening, but, <span
      class="pagenum">460</span><a name="link460" id="link460"></a> when he had
      finished, he very good-humouredly poured out a glass of wine, and, turning
      to me, said, &ldquo;Come then&mdash;here&rsquo;s slavery for ever!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was well understood, and echoed round the table with hearty laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This would do for you completely, Mr. Burke,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Crewe, &ldquo;if it could get into a newspaper! Mr. Burke, they would say,
      has now spoken out; the truth has come to light unguardedly, and his real
      defection from the cause Of true liberty is acknowledged. I should like to
      draw up the paragraph!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And add,&rdquo; said Mr. Burke, &ldquo;the toast was addressed to
      Miss Burney, in order to pay court to the queen!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This sport went on till, upon Mr. Elliot&rsquo;s again mentioning France
      and the rising Jacobins, Mr. Richard Burke loudly gave a new toast&mdash;&ldquo;Come!&rdquo;
      cried he, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s confusion to Confusion!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Windham, who Was gone into Norfolk for the summer, was frequently
      mentioned, and always with praise. Mr. Burke, upon Mr. Elliot&rsquo;s
      saying something of his being very thin, warmly exclaimed, &ldquo;He is
      just as he should be! If I were Windham this minute, I Should not wish to
      be thinner, nor fatter, nor taller, nor shorter, nor any way, nor in
      anything, altered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after, speaking of former days, you may believe I was struck
      enough to hear Mr. Burke say to Mrs. Crewe, &ldquo;I wish you had known
      Mrs. Delany! She was a pattern of a perfect fine lady, a real fine lady,
      of other days! Her manners were faultless; her deportment was all
      elegance, her speech was all sweetness, and her air and address all
      dignity. I always looked up to her as the model of an accomplished woman
      of former times.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you think I heard such a testimony to my most revered and beloved
      departed friend unmoved?
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, still to Mrs. Crewe, he proceeded to say, she had been married
      to Mr. Wycherley, the author.<a href="#linknote-365" name="linknoteref-365"
      id="linknoteref-365"><small>365</small></a> There I ventured to interrupt
      him, and tell him I fancied that must be some <span class="pagenum">461</span><a
      name="link461" id="link461"></a> great mistake, as I had been well
      acquainted with her history from her own mouth. He seemed to have heard it
      from some good authority; but I could by no means accede my belief, as her
      real life and memoirs had been so long in my hands, written by herself to
      a certain period, and, for some way, continued by me. This, however, I did
      not mention.

    <h2>
      A WILD IRISH GIRL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When we left the dining-parlour to the gentlemen, Miss F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      seized my arm, without the smallest previous speech, and, with a
      prodigious Irish brogue, said &ldquo;Miss Burney, I am so glad you can&rsquo;t
      think to have this favourable opportunity of making an intimacy with you!
      I have longed to know you ever since I became rational!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was glad, too, that nobody heard her! She made me walk off with her in
      the garden, whither we had adjourned for a stroll, at a full gallop,
      leaning upon my arm, and putting her face close to mine, and sputtering at
      every word from excessive eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the honour to know some of your relations in Ireland,&rdquo;
      she continued; &ldquo;that is, if they an&rsquo;t yours, which they are
      very sorry for, they are your sister&rsquo;s, which is almost the same
      thing. Mr. Shirley first lent me &lsquo;Cecilia,&rsquo; and he was so
      delighted to hear my remarks! Mrs. Shirley&rsquo;s a most beautiful
      creature; she&rsquo;s grown so large and so big! and all her daughters are
      beautiful; so is all the family. I never saw Captain Phillips, but I dare
      say he&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She is quite a wild Irish girl. Presently she talked of Miss Palmer.
      &ldquo;O, she loves you!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;she says she saw you
      last Sunday, and she never was so happy in her life. She said you looked
      sadly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This Miss F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; is a handsome girl, and seems very good
      humoured. I imagine her but just imported, and I doubt not but the
      soft-mannered, and well-bred, and quiet Mrs. Burke will soon subdue this
      exuberance of loquacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gathered afterwards from Mrs. Crewe, that my curious new acquaintance
      made innumerable inquiries concerning my employment and office under the
      queen. I find many people much disturbed to know whether I had the place
      of the Duchess of Ancastor, on one side, or of a chamber-maid, on the
      other. Truth is apt to lie between conjectures. <span class="pagenum">462</span><a

    <h2>
      ERSKINE&rsquo;S EGOTISM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The party returned with two very singular additions to its number&mdash;Lord
      Loughborough,<a href="#linknote-366" name="linknoteref-366"
      id="linknoteref-366"><small>366</small></a> and Mr. and Mrs. Erskine.<a
      href="#linknote-367" name="linknoteref-367" id="linknoteref-367"><small>367</small></a>
      They have villas at Hampstead, and were met in the walk; Mr. Erskine else
      would not, probably, have desired to meet Mr. Burke, who openly in the
      House of Commons asked him if he knew what friendship meant, when he
      pretended to call him, Mr. Burke, his friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an evident disunion of the cordiality of the party from this
      time. My father, Mr. Richard Burke, his nephew, and Mr. Elliot entered
      into some general discourse; Mr.<span class="pagenum">463</span><a
      name="link463" id="link463"></a> Burke took up a volume Of Boileau, and
      read aloud, though to himself, and with a pleasure that soon made him seem
      to forget all intruders; Lord Loughborough joined Mrs. Burke and Mr.
      Erskine, seating himself next to Mrs. Crewe, engrossed her entirely, yet
      talked loud enough for all to hear who were not engaged themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, I sat next Mrs. Erskine, who seems much a woman of the world, for
      she spoke with me just as freely, and readily, and easily as if we had
      been old friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Erskine enumerated all his avocations to Mrs. Crewe, and, amongst
      others, mentioned, very calmly, having to plead against Mr. Crewe upon a
      manor business in Cheshire. Mrs. Crewe hastily and alarmed interrupted
      him, to inquire what he meant, and what might ensue to Mr. Crewe? &ldquo;O,
      nothing but the loss of the lordship upon that spot,&rdquo; he coolly
      answered; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know that it will be given against him:
      I only know I shall have three hundred Pounds for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crewe looked thoughtful; and Mr. Erskine then began to speak of the
      new Association for Reform, by the friends of the people, headed by
      Messrs. Grey and Sheridan, and sustained by Mr. Fox, and openly opposed by
      Mr. Windham, as well as Mr. Burke. He said much of the use they had made
      of his name, though he had never yet been to the society; and I began to
      understand that he meant to disavow it; but presently he added, &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know whether I shall ever attend&mdash;I have so much to do&mdash;so
      little time: however, the people must be supported."<a href="#linknote-368"
      name="linknoteref-368" id="linknoteref-368"><small>368</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;PRAY, will you tell me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crewe, drily, &ldquo;what
      you mean by the people? I never knew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked surprised, but evaded any answer and soon after took his leave,
      with his wife, who seems by no means to admire him as much as he admires
      himself, if I may judge by short odd speeches which dropped from her. The
      eminence of Mr. Erskine seems all for public life; in private, his
      excessive egotisms undo him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Loughborough instantly took his seat next to Mrs. Crewe; and
      presently related a speech which Mr. Erskine has lately made at some
      public meeting, and which he opened to this effect:&mdash;&ldquo;As to me,
      gentlemen, I have some title to give my opinions freely. Would you know

      CAEN-WOOD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      June 22.&mdash;Mrs. Crewe took my father and myself to see the Hampstead
      lions. We went to Caen-wood, to see the house and pictures. Poor Lord
      Mansfield<a href="#linknote-370" name="linknoteref-370"
      id="linknoteref-370"><small>370</small></a> has not been downstairs, the
      housekeeper told us, for the last four years; yet she asserts he is by no
      means superannuated, and frequently sees his very intimate friends, and
      seldom refuses to be consulted by any lawyers. He was particularly
      connected with my revered Mrs. Delany, and I felt melancholy upon entering
      his house to recollect how often that beloved lady had planned carrying
      thither Miss Port and myself, and how often we had been invited by Miss
      Murrays, my lord&rsquo;s nieces. I asked after those ladies, and left them
      my respects. I heard they were up-stairs with Lord Mansfield, whom they
      never left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many things in this house were interesting, because historical but I fancy
      the pictures, at least, not to have much other recommendation. A portrait
      Of Pope, by himself, I thought extremely curious. It is very much in the
      style of most of Jervas&rsquo;s own paintings. They told us that, after
      the burning of Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s house in town, at the time of Lord
      G. Gordon&rsquo;s riots, thousands came to inquire, if this original
      portrait was preserved. Luckily it was at Caen-wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      We spent a good deal of time in the library,&mdash;and saw first editions
      of almost all Queen Anne&rsquo;s classics; and lists of subscribers to
      Pope&rsquo;s &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; and many such matters, all enlivening to
      some corner or other of the memory.

    <h2>
      AN ADVENTURE WITH MRS. CREWE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We next proceeded to the Shakspeare gallery,<a href="#linknote-371"
      name="linknoteref-371" id="linknoteref-371"><small>371</small></a> which I
      had <span class="pagenum">465</span><a name="link465" id="link465"></a>
      never seen. And here we met with an adventure that finished our morning&rsquo;s
      excursions.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a lady in the first room, dressed rather singularly, quite
      alone, and extremely handsome, who was parading about with a nosegay in
      her hand, which she frequently held to her nose, in a manner that was
      evidently calculated to attract notice. We therefore passed on to the
      inner room, to avoid her. Here we had but just all taken our stand
      opposite different pictures, when she also entered, and, coming pretty
      close to my father, sniffed at her flowers with a sort of extatic
      eagerness, and then let them fall. My father picked them up, and gravely
      presented them to her. She curtsied to the ground in receiving them, and
      presently crossed over the room, and, brushing past Mrs. Crewe, seated
      herself immediately by her elbow. Mrs. Crewe, not admiring this
      familiarity, moved away, giving her at the same time a look of dignified
      distance that was almost petrifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not prove so to this lady, who presently followed her to the next
      picture, and, sitting as close as she could to where Mrs. Crewe stood,
      began singing various quick passages, without words or connexion. I saw
      Mrs. Crewe much alarmed, and advanced to stand by her, meaning to whisper
      her that we had better leave the room; and this idea was not checked by
      seeing that the flowers were artificial. By the looks we interchanged we
      soon mutually said, &ldquo;This is a mad woman.&rdquo; We feared
      irritating her by a sudden flight, but gently retreated, and soon got
      quietly into the large room when she bounced up with a great noise, and,
      throwing the veil of her bonnet violently back, as if fighting it, she
      looked after us, pointing at Mrs. Crewe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seriously frightened, Mrs. Crewe seized my father&rsquo;s arm, and hurried
      up two or three steps into a small apartment. Here Mrs. Crewe, addressing
      herself to an elderly gentleman, asked if he could inform the people below
      that a mad woman was terrifying the company; and while he was receiving
      her commission with the most profound respect, and with an evident air of
      admiring astonishment at her beauty, we heard a rustling, and, looking
      round, saw the same figure hastily striding after us, and in an instant at
      our elbows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crewe turned quite pale; it was palpable she was the object pursued,
      and she most civilly and meekly articulated, &ldquo;I beg your pardon, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
      as she hastily passed her, and hurried down the steps. We were going to
      run for our lives, <span class="pagenum">466</span><a name="link466"
      id="link466"></a> when Miss Townshend whispered Mrs. Crewe it was Only
      Mrs. Wells the actress, and said she was certainly Only performing
      vagaries to try effect, which she was quite famous for doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been food for a painter to have seen Mrs. Crewe during this
      explanation. All her terror instantly gave way to indignation; and
      scarcely any pencil could equal the high vivid glow of her cheeks. To find
      herself made the object of game to the burlesque humour of a bold player,
      was an indignity she could not brook, and her mind was immediately at work
      how to assist herself against such unprovoked and unauthorized effrontery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elderly gentleman who, with great eagerness, had followed Mrs. Crewe,
      accompanied by a young man who was of his party, requested more
      particularly her commands; but before Mrs. Crewe&rsquo;s astonishment and
      resentment found words, Mrs. Wells, singing, and throwing herself into
      extravagant attitudes, again rushed down the steps, and fixed her eyes on
      Mrs. Crewe. This, however, no longer served her purpose. Mrs. Crewe fixed
      her in return, and with a firm, composed, commanding air and look that,
      though it did not make this strange creature retreat, somewhat
      disconcerted her for a few minutes. She then presently affected a violent
      coughing such a one as almost shook the room; though such a forced and
      unnatural noise as rather resembled howling than a cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      This over, and perceiving Mrs. Crewe still steadily keeping her ground,
      she had the courage to come up to us, and, with a flippant air, said to
      the elderly gentleman, &ldquo;Pray, sir, will you tell me what it is o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked vexed to be called a moment from looking at Mrs. Crewe, and,
      with a forbidding gravity, answered her, &ldquo;About two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No offence, I hope, sir?&rdquo; cried she, seeing him turn eagerly
      from her. He bowed without looking at her, and she strutted away, still,
      however, keeping in sight, and playing various tricks, her eyes
      perpetually turned towards Mrs. Crewe, who as regularly, met them, with an
      expression such as might have turned a softer culprit to stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our cabal was again renewed, and Mrs. Crewe again told this gentleman to
      make known to the proprietors of the gallery that this person was a
      nuisance to the company, when, suddenly re-approaching as, she called out,
      &ldquo;Sir! sir!&rdquo; to the younger of our new protectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      He coloured, and looked much alarmed, but only bowed. <span class="pagenum">467</span><a
      name="link467" id="link467"></a> &ldquo;Pray, sir,&rdquo; cried she,
      &ldquo;what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch, and answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t take it ill, I hope, sir?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He only bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do no harm, sir,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I never bite.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor young man looked aghast, and bowed lower; but Mrs. Crewe,
      addressing herself to the elder, said aloud, &ldquo;I beg you, sir, to go
      to Mr. Boydell; you may name me to him&mdash;Mrs. Crewe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wells at this walked away, yet still in sight. &ldquo;You may tell
      him what has happened, sir, in all our names. You may tell him Miss Burney&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no!&rdquo; cried I, in a horrid fright, &ldquo;I beseech I may
      not be named! And, indeed, ma&rsquo;am, it may be better to let it all
      alone. It will do no good; and it may all get into the newspapers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it does,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Crewe, &ldquo;what is it to us?
      We have done nothing; we have given no offence, and made no disturbance.
      This person has frightened us all wilfully, and Utterly without
      provocation; and now she can frighten us no longer, she would brave us.
      Let her tell her own story, and how will it harm us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;I must always fear being brought into
      any newspaper cabals. Let the fact be ever so much against her, she will
      think the circumstances all to her honour if a paragraph comes out
      beginning &lsquo;Mrs. Crewe and Mrs. Wells.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crewe liked this sound as little as I should have liked it in placing
      my own name where I put hers. She hesitated a little what to do, and we
      all walked down-stairs, where instantly this bold woman followed us,
      paraded Up and down the long shop with a dramatic air while our group was
      in conference, and then, sitting down at the clerk&rsquo;s desk, and
      calling in a footman, she desired him to wait while she wrote a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      She scribbled a few lines, and read aloud her direction, &ldquo;To Mr.
      Topham;&rdquo; and giving the note to the man, said, &ldquo;Tell your
      master that is something to make him laugh. Bid him not send to the press
      till I see him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now as Mr. Topham is the editor of &ldquo;The World,&rdquo; and
      notoriously her protector, as her having his footman acknowledged, this
      looked rather serious, and Mrs. Crewe began to partake of my alarm. She
      therefore, to my infinite satisfaction, told her new friend that she
      desired he would name no names, but merely mention that some ladies had
      been frightened.... <span class="pagenum">468</span><a name="link468"
      id="link468"></a> We then got into Mrs. Crewe&rsquo;s carriage, and not
      till then would this facetious Mrs. Wells quit the shop. And she walked in
      sight, dodging us, and playing antics of a tragic sort of gesture, till we
      drove out of her power to keep up with us. What a strange creature!

      AN INVITATION FROM ARTHUR YOUNG.
    </h2>
    <p>
      (Mr. Arthur Young to Fanny Burney.) Bradfield Farm, June 18, 1792. WHAT a
      plaguy business &rsquo;tis to take up one&rsquo;s pen to write to a person
      who is constantly moving in a vortex of pleasure, brilliancy, and wit,&mdash;whose
      movements and connections are, as it were, in another world! One knows not
      how to manage the matter with such folks, till you find by a little
      approximation and friction of tempers and things that they are mortal, and
      no more than good sort of people in the main, only garnished with
      something we do not possess ourselves. Now then, the consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only three pages to write, and one lost in introduction! To the matter at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemeth that you make a journey to Norfolk. Now do ye see, if you do
      not give a call on the farmer, and examine his ram (an old acquaintance),
      his bull, his lambs, calves, and crops, he will say but one thing of you&mdash;that
      you are fit for a court, but not for a farm; and there is more happiness
      to be found among my rooks than in the midst of all the princes and
      princesses of Golconda. I would give an hundred pound to see you married
      to a farmer that never saw London, with plenty of poultry ranging in a few
      green fields, and flowers and shrubs disposed where they should be, around
      a cottage, and not around a breakfast-room in Portman-square, fading in
      eyes that know not to admire them. In honest truth now, let me request
      your company here. It will give us all infinite pleasure. You are
      habituated to admiration, but you shall have here what is much better&mdash;the
      friendship of those who loved you long before the world admired you. Come,
      and make old friends happy!

      Henry VII. The letter above alluded to is No. 91 in the collection. It is
      a letter of good Counsel to his young son, written in a very tender and
      religious strain, by the Duke of Suffolk, on the 30th of April, 1450, the
      day on which he quitted England to undergo his five years&rsquo;
      banishment. The duke had been impeached of high treason, and condemned to
      this term of banishment, through the king&rsquo;s interposition, to save
      him from a worse fate. But his fate was not to be eluded. He set sail on

      poverty, were hated in France, both as Court favourites, and on account of
      the wealth which, it was believed, they had taken advantage of their
      position to amass. &ldquo;Mille ecus,&rdquo; cried Mirabeau, &ldquo;A la

      of some scurrilous Memoirs which it was rumoured his wife had written, and
      in which, among other things, Marie Antoinette was accused of being the
      principal culprit in the notorious Diamond Necklace fraud. M. de la Motte

      Sister-in-law, the Countess Diane, at the Duchess of Devonshire&rsquo;s
      (the beautiful Georgiana), at the request of the latter, when certain
      overtures were made to him, and trustworthy authorities assert that a
      large sum of money was afterwards paid to the De la Mottes, to suppress
      the Memoirs which were however eventually published. When the French
      Revolution broke out the Polignacs were among the first to emigrate. The

      Khan, the Nawab of Rampore; but this charge, with many others of the
      original articles of impeachment, was not proceeded upon at the trial.
      Fyzoolla Khan was one of the Rohilla chiefs, who, more fortunate than the
      rest, had been permitted by treaty, after the conquest of Rohilcund in 17
      74, to retain possession of Rampore as a vassal of the Vizier of Oude. By
      this treaty the Nawab of Rampore was empowered to maintain an army of
      5,000 horse and foot in all and in return he bound himself to place from
      2,000 to 3,000 troops at the disposal of the Vizier whenever that
      assistance might be required. In November, 1780, the Vizier, or rather,
      Hastings, speaking by the mouth of the Vizier, called upon Fyzoolla Khan
      to furnish forthwith a contingent of 5,000 horse. The unhappy Nawab
      offered all the assistance in his power, but not only Was the demand
      unwarranted by the terms of the treaty, but the number of horse required
      was far greater than he had the means to furnish. Thereupon Mr. Hastings
      gave permission to the Vizier to dispossess his vassal of his dominions.
      This iniquitous scheme, however, was never carried out, and in 1782,
      Fyzoolla Khan made his peace with the Governor-General, and procured his
      own future exemption from military service, by payment of a large sum of
      money.&mdash; ED.]

      played the part of &ldquo;Peggy,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Margery Punchwife&rdquo;
      of Wycherley&rsquo;s play. It was in this part that she made her first
      appearance in London, at Drury Lane, October 18, 1785. She was one of the
      most admired actresses of her time. Genest, who saw her, writes of her,
      &ldquo;As an actress she never had a superior in her proper line Mrs.
      Jordan&rsquo;s Country Girl, Romp, Miss Hoyden, and all characters of that
      description were exquisite&mdash;in breeches parts no actress can be put
      in competition with her but Mrs. Woffington, and to Mrs. Woffington she
      was as superior in point of voice as Mrs. Woffington was superior to her
      in beauty&rdquo; (viii. p. 430). Mrs. Jordan died at St. Cloud, July 5,
      1816, aged fifty. There is an admirable portrait of her by Romney in the
      character of the &ldquo;Country Girl.&rdquo;&mdash;ED.]

      cause&rdquo; was one of the causes celebres of its tine. Its history is
      briefly as follows. In 1746 Lady Jane Douglas married Sir John Stewart. At
      Paris, in July, 1748, she gave birth to twins, Archibald and Sholto, of
      whom the latter died an infant. Lady Jane herself died in 1753. The
      surviving child, Archibald, was always recognized as their son by Lady
      Jane and Sir John. In 1760 the Duke of Douglas, the brother of Lady Jane,
      being childless, recognised his sister&rsquo;s son as his heir, and
      bequeathed to him by will the whole of the Douglas estates, revoking, for
      that purpose, a previous testament which he had made in favour of the
      Hamilton family. The Duke died in 1761, and Archibald, who had assumed his
      mother&rsquo;s, name of Douglas, duly succeeded to the estates. His right,
      however, Was disputed at law by the Duke of Hamilton, on the pretence,
      which he sought to establish, that Archibald Douglas was not in fact the
      son of his reputed mother. The Lords of Session in Scotland decided in
      favour of the Duke of Hamilton, whereupon Mr. Douglas appealed to the
      House of Lords, which reversed the decision of the Scottish court
      (February 2-, 1769), 1, &ldquo;thereby confirming to Mr. Douglas his
      Filiation and his Fortune.&rdquo;&mdash;ED.]

      five months at Otaheite demoralized the crew, to whom the dolce farniente
      of life in a Pacific island, and the Charms of the Otaheitan women,
      offered greater attractions than the toils of sea-faring under a somewhat

      debate and his want of public principle. Previously a member of the

      North with the Solicitor- Generalship. He defended Lord Clive in 1773.

      views on the Regency question in 1788-9, but when the split in the Whig
      party on the subject of the French Revolution took place, Loughborough,

      regarded as seditious. Erskine was a member of one or more of these
      associations, and one of his most brilliant triumphs at the bar was
      connected with the prosecution by government (October, 1794), of Hardy
      Thelwall and Horne Tooke for high treason, as members of one of these
      supposed seditious societies. The prisoners were defended by Erskine and
      acquitted. Erskine became Lord Chancellor in 1806 after the death of Pitt.&mdash;ED.]

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
